89,"With the benefit of hindsight Age of Ultron is a good movie but the trailers raised the expectations for the movie to be more in tune with Infinity war, in that Ultron would be super menacing and have a major presence throughout the movie. Kinda like Thanos has in Infinity war. I think thats the main reason AoU disapointed people. Its not that Ultron was poorly made but its more the fact that he had no real presence they made him into Loki 2.0 He did the exact same things as Loki did in Avengers 1 only they didnt have a movie's worth of backstory and character building so by the time you get to know him Its over. However in the comics Ultron is nothing if not resilient so I wouldnt be too surprised if he were to make a return in the future and if he does maybe he will get to do some more original stuff.",tmeOjFno6Do

296,Both the quality of writing and the graphics are very inconsistent. For example the main dinosaur usually looks perfectly fine. But there are other parts in the film where an insignificant dinosaur will walk past the screen for five seconds and it will look like absolute shit. Kind of like the animals from the old Jumanji. Not that I'm saying Jumanji was a bad film. But let's be honest the CGI was terrible. Then there is the writing which is often at the same level of quality as the old Jurassic Park. But there are also moments where the writing suddenly plummets in quality to such an extent that I'm not even sure what is happening. Like when the mother abruptly starts crying. She says some crap about the importance of family. But apparently she is too much of a snob to spend any time with her sister herself. So it just comes across as gibberish to me. Secondly how the hell does an animal know what the hell a tracking device is? Even a human being wouldn't know what the hell a tracking device is unless it was explained to them. It doesn't matter how intelligent you are. There still needs to be a basis for the assumption that the device is magically giving away your location. They never suggested that the dinosaur just found the device to be itchy. It was meant to be a demonstration of its intelligence. Apparently the dinosaur remembers where they surgically implanted the tracking device. But I assume they would have sedated it first in which case it should have no memory of anything past that it woke up one day with a sore shoulder or wherever the hell they put it. Don't get me wrong I enjoyed the film for the most part. I'm just saying that there are these weird moments where there is a sudden plummet in quality. Though as for the graphics I think it's understandable. They probably only had so much money to work with so they had to cut corners with some of the background dinosaurs.,RFinNxS5KN4

469,"On different note...

Hollywood needs to sto mpaking 2 & a half to 3 minute trailers that show way too much of the movie to the point there's no point going to see it in the cinema...

Granted this isn't one of the worst but by putting Dialogue along with a specific with scene in the movie is ridiculous & I'm talking about Scotty saying "" The Ship's Dead, It Totally Gone ""
Then you see the Enterprise rise out of the water as if it's a Phoenix reborn, when it's a totally different scene that happens in the opening of the movie...

This is playing with fans emotions as the Enterprise is as much a part of the Crew as the rest of Cast & this is coming from someone who's not a huge fan of Star Trek... it's akin to a character in a Star Wars film saying the exact same words as Scotty does but by let's say Princes Leia, then it cuts to the Millennium Falcon...

I watched all the original episodes from the TV Series & then all the spawned TV shows thereafter, along with the 5 Films with the old cast & now these films...

They are all good films all of them in their own way & within their own concept at the time they were made but again I like many others say "" Stop Showing Trialers that long & show too much within the trailer ""

I understand that the cinema has completion from TV Channels buying the rights & showing films some years done the line/their launch on DVD & Blu Ray & of course Piracy..

The one that's been added is maybe casting for Apps as all other ones have existed in one way or another in the past as in DVD/Blu Ray it was VHS or Betamax & piracy has been with us since the early 80s, yet Hollywood & other countrys make these trailers way too long...

I only watched 30 seconds of this trailer to know (if I needed to anyway) that I was going to watch this film...

In the 70s & 80s all you got was a deep voiced basic monologue of the film with a Poster showing & that was it & yet we somehow spawned the New in thing The Summer Blockbuster...

I remember as a kid watching the the Ads in Cinema's before theain feature showed in 1975 for "" Jaws "" & all it contained was the usual deep voiced brief monologue with an image of the sea & all the voice actor said was
 "" Jaws Go & Watch This Movie Before You Swim In The Sea Again ""

As any cinema fan knows that movie spearheaded & started the begining of what we take for granted now which is 
"" The Summer Blockbuster *

There is an old saying "" Less Is More "" & it worked for the movie industry up until the advent of easily accessible online viewing whether it's YouTube/Facebook et al...

Withoit being  preachy  just one more thing before I go as I did this once in the 80s & that was I foulishly listened to a well known TV Critic who had a weekly show that showed a Brief Trailer of the films & then the critic give His Opinion of the each movie..
The problem was he was an out & out snob when it came to movies as his Father was well known for directing B&W War Movies, but the show was essential viewing as it was it's only kind at the time but my point is go & see a movie or rent it as i have found that critics in my opinion are by in their own way single minded & no doubt jealous in some way because they cant make something come to life...

Anyone again "" in my opinion "" that gets paid to criticize someone else body of work is embarrassing & I'd never admit to having that kind of job yet these people are paid huge amounts of money to either give a good review or bad review & that is way too much power for individuals to have over the masses...

Make up your own mind & stick it as you may find you've just watched a movie You Really Enjoyed & not some critic sitting their arse getting paid to be disrespectful towards others who are actually trying to create something that will appeal to a broad spectrum of people worldwide & that's not easy to do...

After years of grief, Rick re-marries and starts calling his new wife 'Evie' as a result of insanity, she accepts her husband as he is and legally changes her name to Evelyn Carnahan. When Rick looks at her, he doesn't really see her, he only sees his beloved Evie. And he'll only ever see Evie until his dying day.",5-4qSE2Ch0Y

It's funny how we show arabs or muslims as unstable, dangerous and incompetent in all our movies sponsored by the cia or our military financiers but rarely do we look in the mirror to see where the evil truly stems from. This piece of biased crap plus the second movie both are obsessively biased towards one narrative, the American. What's touted as the undefeatable force is shown to be the most unstable and incompetent throughout these movies. The bad guys are from among our own, better trained, more determined, resourceful and have more advanced technology. It's like we create our own enemies and then constantly give them traits and characteristics to justify constant harassment of arabs and perpetual war on their homelands.

951,"By far the best F&F film to date. However...i have to say, I am really impressed with the fact that a franchise can make 8+ movies, and *_still_* not only are thry on the big screen, but most of them are pretty damn good...some are okay and some are great. But the way they keep it all going with the plot twists, almost always different plotlines, bringing in new celebrity actors for almost every new film (Dwayne Johnson, Kurt Russell, Charlize Theron, female UFC fighters such as Ronda Rousey 👈LoL!!), all while keeping the same, original crew together after 17+ years. Now *_THAT_* is impressive. I don't care what anyone says.
People are so accustomed to and used to a movie franchise that has so many sequels (Friday The 13th, Halloween, Saw, Star Wars, The Alien Franchise, Final Destination, Jaws, i could go on all day) to automatically just being really really bad and not worth watching. And in their defense, most of them are pretty awful, and also are usually so bad they go straight to DvD (Think: Child's Play). 
So anyway, when someone goes into a movie with the frame of mind that it's going to be really bad, well, it usually is because they have that frame of mind for the entire film. Usually just waiting for it to take that hard left turn. Which it usually does. But when it turns out to be really good, they might think ""well, this wasnt bad at all"" but since they had that frame of mind for the entire film, it's almost impossible for them to forget all about the fact that you thought it would suck, and you can't really enjoy it as much as you could have, had you gone into the movie with an open mind, or thinking that it just might be good.
   So anyway, this post is long, sorry. To the point...
If you go back and re-watch ANY of these sequels that you thought were bad or ""would be"" bad, and you make yourself think they are going to be really great, then you will certainly enjoy it more, and also you will probably like it. 
  It's all a psychological thing and it really works. 
Just a brief example: way back when, I was just a kid and went to see 'Titanic' in the theater. I really disliked that type of movie as a kid, like most kids do. And initially didnt want to see it. But eventually i heard from several people, all over school, all over the tv, how amazing it was, and how everyone wants to see it again, etc. 
When i saw it, I liked it a lot. However, about 5 years ago I watched it again. Surprisingly i hadnt seen it since i was about 14 so i forgot most of it. Anyway, i didnt like it much at all and was curious as to why i liked such a film *_more_* at 14 than as an adult? It should've been the other way around. 
But again, it's all a psychological thing and bcuz i went into the theater with the mindset that it was a great movie. So i really actually enjoyed it at the time. 
   Anyway, thats something i learnes in college about how the mind works and can sometimes play tricks on you. Making you actually think and believe what you want to, and how easily it can happen. Very, very interesting topic.

1071,"█░░█ 
█▀▀█ 
▀░░▀ere are some helpful videos which give some background as to why Greeks are so eager to shout over just about anyone or flood almost every comment section mentioning Macedonia. And these videos should also help good people not be so easily duped and avoid making silly uneducated statements on behalf of Greece. Now the first helpful video. Here you will learn that the country of Greece was established in the first half of the 19th century -- YouTube: The Documentary That Shocked Greece - Skai ""1821"" 

Secondly this video explains how Macedonia was illegally partitioned in the beginning of the 20th century. This was after Greece was established and sore for the very first time part of Macedonia become Greece. This event explains the actions of the neighbours towards Macedonia as well -- YouTube: Hans-Lothar Steppan On The Macedonian Question: Greece Never Possessed Macedonian Territories Before 1912-13 

Thirdly learn there has been ethnic cleansing committed over this part of Macedonia which Greece was granted in 1913. Greece's aim of erasing the ethnic Macedonians identity or even removing them all together. Being that the Macedonians are the indigenous ethnic group of Macedonia Greece swapped them out with people more favorable towards Greece that are accepting of being solely Greek -- YouTube this video which includes English subtitles: Genocide On The Macedonians Геноцид На Македонците 

This fourth video presents what was a known fact before which is now obscured. Here in this old documentary ancient Macedonia is described as having not been ancient Greek. This must have been before the fresh historians of today and newer TV documentaries fully established their new narrative that everything ancient Macedonia was Greek -- YouTube: Macedonia - The Clip That Shocked Greece 

Fifth combats the theory that some kind of Slavic migration has resulted in today's Macedonians having zero connection to ancient Macedonians. Here science has not only confirmed that both ancient Macedonians and ancient Hellenic people were two distinct races but also that each ancient race is distributed within the respective populous of each country -- YouTube: Dna Of Macedonian People By Igenea 

And the final video here explains about the lexicon by Hesychius of Alexandria from the 5th century AD. In this lexicon the Macedonian language is placed with other foreign languages separated to the Greek language. Simply the Macedonians always had a separate language to the Greeks. And interestingly this book has not been released in full which should make anyone wonder what is going on -- YouTube: The Ancient Macedonians Were Not Greek! (Episode 31 Of 40)",Bh6LKIdxqCU

1287,"Abberline who Johnny Depp played in ""From Hell"" enlisted in the London Police on January 5, 1863. 106 years later Led Zeppelin and the Grateful Dead were performing in San Francisco the night the Antichrist was born January 5, 1969. Eighteen thousand landslides occurred on January 5, 1982 that killed 33 in San Francisco on the 49th anniversary of the start of the Golden Gate Bridge which also coincided with Marilyn Mansons 13th birthday. On January 5, 2018 Manson turned 49 and the Kodovar volcano erupted for the first time in recorded history. Philadelphia is one of the 7 churches of Revelation. The Eagles won there first Superbowl in 2018. Philly to Canton Ohio is 333 miles as the crow flies. Canton is where Manson was born and is home of the football Hall of Fame. Canton to Chicago is 333 miles as the crow flies. This adds up to the 666 the number of the beast. Chicago is where Anton Lavey published the satanic the same year Manson was born. They became friends after first meeting at the  “Black house” in SF where Anyone founded the church of Satan. Alcatraz is named the Rock which stands for Peter the Rock Jesus's best friend. When the Birdman of Alcatraz died he was buried in Metropolis Superman's hometown. The steel used to build the Golden Gate is Bethlehem Steel named after Jesus's hometown. Metropolis is 333 miles as the crow flies from Ft. Wayne my hometown. San Francisco is named for the same Saint that the pope chose his papal name to be. The flag of SF is of the Phoenix, a mythical bird who is associated with Jesus because of its ability to resurrect. In the 1962 movie ""the Birdman of Alcatraz"" the first bird he saves is a sparrow which he names Jack.  In Pirates of the Caribbean Johny Depp plays Captain Jack Sparrow. Johnny Depp, the Birdman of Miami, and Birdman the rapper are all named Christopher. Birdman the movie was originally written to involve Johnny Depp. Depp is best friends with Marilyn Manson who In 1996 said ""Hopefully I will be remembered for the one who brought an end to Christianity."" That same year he released ""Antichrist Superstar."" I was born on January 27, 1980 and the Birdman was born on January 28, 1890. On January 28, 1986 the space shuttle Challenger exploded killing all 7 on board including a school teacher named Christa. Every ten year anniversary since people who has had a very significant impact on the world have died and they are all connected by a bird, a plane, and Superman. On the first 10 year anniversary Jerry Siegal the creator of Superman died on January 28, 1996, The Birdman's 106th B-day. 10 years later Rabbi Yitskah Kaduri died January 28, 2006. Rabbi Kaduri had the largest funeral in Israel's history and is known for writing a letter which was opened a year after his death which states Jesus is the true Messiah. Ten years later Signe Toly and Paul Kantner of Jefferson Airplane from SF died on January 28, 2016. On the 5 year anniversary of the death of the Rabbi an Angel appeared over the Dome of Rock  on January 28, 2011. George Reeves who was the only Superman to be killed was born on January 5 as well which coincides with National bird day. Revelation talks about how birds devour the antichrist and his armies. Alfred Hitchcock's movie ""The Birds"" was filmed in SF. Morgan Stanley who was born 49 years before the Birdman was the was the inspiration for the book ""Heart of Darkness."" The Birdman was sent to Alcatraz for stabbing a guard through the heart. In 1996 I became paralyzed the first time I heard the song ""Beautiful People."" In 2001 a demons voice guided me to Mansons autobiography ""The Long Hard Road out Of Hell."" In 2003 Carmelo Anthony led the Syracuse Orangemen to their first NCAA title in 2003 over Kansas. The morning after that game I walked the yellow brick road after almost drowning where the St. Joseph and St. Marys rivers meet.  The first person I met at St. Joe was a man who claimed to be OZ. OZ had a branding on his forearm that had the ""Echo"" logo on it. The Rhinoceros logo was the same size and shape of the logo on the side of the reddish orange Echo shoes I was given earlier that day by my friend Scot after I got out of the river barefoot. “the Dark side of the Rainbow"" is a story about how Pink Floyds Darkside of the moon syncs up with the Wizard of Oz. This story originated with a 1995 Journal Gazette article in Ft Wayne the same city I walked the yellow brick road 8 years later. 2003 was the same year I climbed the Anthony Wayne building on St. Pat's. It was an Orange year in 2003. The Ft. Wayne Komets, the Buccaneers,  and the Orangemen all won that year. My stepdad Joseph owned a motorcycle shop which was orange and all of his drag racing motorcycles were orange as well. The Wizard of OZ is a story about the defeat of the antichrist. The water making the Witch melt is a metaphor for baptism. All of the teams in Fort Wayne are named after the Wizard of OZ. The Tin Caps are the baseball team which would be The Tin Woodsman. Before they were the Tin caps they were the Wizards. Johnny Appleseed is the original Tin woodsman who is buried in Ft. Wayne. The Komet hockey team used to be the Choppers. Nick Chopper is the Tin Man's name.The Ft. Wayne Mad Ants would be the “Aunty M’s.” In ""Return to Oz"" Dorothy is sent to the psyche ward. The Doctor tries to give her a shock treatment then lighting knocks the power out. Dorothy escapes out of a window and gets swept away by a river which takes her back to OZ. In 2003 I got swept away by a river where I ended up meeting OZ in the phyche ward. The Doctor then tried to give me a shock treatment. I tried to escape out of the window as well. I haven't aged a day since the river incident in 2003 when I was 23. My mothers first tattoo was Peter Pan on her neck and she still doesn't know who I am. I used to rap as Reaces Peace's and Marshall Mathers  rapped as M&M. M&M was born in St. Joseph Missouri and I was born at St. Joseph Hospital. We are both left handed and have blue eyes. M&M's middle name is Bruce and he grew up in Wayne county. Batman is Bruce Wayne named after Mad Anthony Wayne the founder of Batman. Peter the Rock is the original Batman. Peter was crucified upside down upon his request. There was a man on the Kansas team in 2003 whose name is Wayne Anthony the founder of Ft. Wayne's name backwards. Wayne who later won an NBA title with Miami was injured and could not play in that championship game. Wayne is now a preacher. The son of man is Jesus and the son of man backwards is Man son. Peyton Manning went to play for a horse of a different color, from the Colts to the Broncos. Brock OS(OZ) Weiller Quarterbacked most of there Superbowl winning season. Manning’s favorite thing to say at the line of scrimmage was“Omaha."" Omaha is what is written on the side of the Hot Air Balloon at the end of the Wizard of Oz. In Superbowl 48 Peyton was defeated by, “the Emerald city"", Seattle. In Super Bowl 50 Peyton defeated Superman at the 49ers Cathedral. I was born on January 27, the same as Nick Mason of Pink Floyd. The Dark side of the moon starts with the song ""Breathe"" which has a lyric ""run rabbit run."" Eminem played ""B Rabbit"" in the movie 8 mile which is based on “Run rabbit run"" written by John Updyke. John died 7 years later on my birthday. M&M released the song ""the Yellow Brick road"" and Elton John released the album “leaving the Yellow Brick road."" At the 2001 Grammys they performed the song ""Stan,"" together. M&M released his autobiography ""the dark side of Eminem"" the chapter ""Stan"" starts on my birthday page 127. Stan Lee created Spiderman and when Dorothy runs away the first person she meets is professor Marvel. Spiderman is from Marvel comics. I became Spiderman in 2003 and also dated Mary Jane who was also born in Canton Ohio the same city as Marilyn Manson. Andre the Giant who shares my last name and who also climbed walls of insanity in the Princess Bride died on my 13th Birthday 1/27/93. Andre was born exactly 127 miles from where my Great Grandfather was born in Belfort France. Belfort is the birthplace of the man who sculpted the statue of Liberty. My name Nickolas Giant contains two New York teams. Manson has been working on the movie “Phantasmagoria"" where he plays an evil Lewis Carrol. Lewis lived most of his life from a college named after Christ. Carrol who wrote Alice in Wonderland was also born on January 27. Johnny Depp played the Mad Hatter. The founder of Ft. Wayne is Mad Anthony Wayne. Barbara Hershey who played Mary Magdalene in Oliver Stone’s last Temptation of Christ was on the set of a movie when she felt the Spirit of a Seagull enter her body. She then changed her last name to Seagull. In 2002 Ja Rule played an inmate on Alcatraz alongside Steven Seagull under the name ""Nickolas"" in the movie Half past Dead. In 2003 Ja Rule was trying to murder 50 Cent the same time I felt he was trying to murder me. There is a reason 50 Cent got shot 9 times and didn't die. In 2001 After a trip from Detroit with my best friend Life a red orb appeared and told me it was my Angel of light. It then told me I was Jesus. Later that night I thanked God for telling me I was Jesus, then the voice told me I was never coming back. I got home an hour later and my girlfriend told me while I was gone a voice told her I was never coming back. I thought I committed an unforgivable sin by believing I was Jesus. I asked for forgiveness for believing the voice. I got depressed and tried to hang myself but the hook ripped out of the ceiling and I decided not to do it. Later I read Corinthians 11:14, which says ""The devil will come to you as an Angel of light.""  This is what the orb told me before it said I was Jesus. I realized it was the devil who tried to deceive me into killing myself. I knew from then on I had a purpose.",N6tVdffCr_M

1502,"Okay, Dreamworks is clearly losing against their competitors. Maybe not in money terms, but certainly in reputation and respect. I remember when they used to be renowned for their snarky, sarcastic, kids AND adults targeted movies. Kids would love it, but so would the adults. With Disney, yes it's there, but it wasn't as prominent with both targets. Clearly, Dreamworks is losing that streak. Trolls was the biggest proof of this. A by-the-book kids movie. Predictable plot, nearly one-note characters (except for the main two characters), and a juke box musical. Their last movie that striked both adults and kids like they used to was Kung Fu Panda 3. Well, even though the people want something original, they could start off with something a little more simple than a completely 100% original concept. Like Rise of the Guardians 2. It's what a lot of people want and the characters are still memorable, (although Tooth could use a little more development), and it has animation that has still not been topped by any of your other movies. And you now know what to fix. The clunky writing, the mainly kids targeted plot and humor, and some more development for some characters. It's a redeeming chance. You could even rework it to have that orignal snarky, and sarcastic attitude that we saw more with Bunny and Jack, and bring it to some other characters.

And I know they won't ever see this, but it's nice to get it off my chest. I know they're just gonna keep pandering to focus groups and the masse.

Now Bruce Banner and the Hulk are no longer geniuses and needed superheroes. Banner no longer has his combat moves (even though he did in this solo film and was shown in the training process). It's almost as if the character is now nothing but surplus of labor, no individuality, no story of his own, no direction, no goals, nothing.
An easy way to fix this would be to buy the rights to the Hulk character back from Universal Studios, and make a solo movie with Ruffalo. The Incredible Hulk 2, which fixes all of these dumb mistakes, and makes Hulk feel like an actual, important part of The Avengers family.",xbqNb2PFKKA

1864,"Daniel 7 New Revised Standard Version (NRSV)
Visions of the Four Beasts
7 In the first year of King Belshazzar of Babylon, Daniel had a dream and visions of his head as he lay in bed. Then he wrote down the dream:[a] 2 I,[b] Daniel, saw in my vision by night the four winds of heaven stirring up the great sea, 3 and four great beasts came up out of the sea, different from one another. 4 The first was like a lion and had eagles’ wings. Then, as I watched, its wings were plucked off, and it was lifted up from the ground and made to stand on two feet like a human being; and a human mind was given to it. 5 Another beast appeared, a second one, that looked like a bear. It was raised up on one side, had three tusks[c] in its mouth among its teeth and was told, “Arise, devour many bodies!” 6 After this, as I watched, another appeared, like a leopard. The beast had four wings of a bird on its back and four heads; and dominion was given to it. 7 After this I saw in the visions by night a fourth beast, terrifying and dreadful and exceedingly strong. It had great iron teeth and was devouring, breaking in pieces, and stamping what was left with its feet. It was different from all the beasts that preceded it, and it had ten horns. 8 I was considering the horns, when another horn appeared, a little one coming up among them; to make room for it, three of the earlier horns were plucked up by the roots. There were eyes like human eyes in this horn, and a mouth speaking arrogantly.

Judgment before the Ancient One
9 As I watched,
thrones were set in place,
    and an Ancient One[d] took his throne,
his clothing was white as snow,
    and the hair of his head like pure wool;
his throne was fiery flames,
    and its wheels were burning fire.
10 A stream of fire issued
    and flowed out from his presence.
A thousand thousands served him,
    and ten thousand times ten thousand stood attending him.
The court sat in judgment,
    and the books were opened.

11 I watched then because of the noise of the arrogant words that the horn was speaking. And as I watched, the beast was put to death, and its body destroyed and given over to be burned with fire. 12 As for the rest of the beasts, their dominion was taken away, but their lives were prolonged for a season and a time. 13 As I watched in the night visions,

I saw one like a human being[e]
    coming with the clouds of heaven.
And he came to the Ancient One[f]
    and was presented before him.
14 To him was given dominion
    and glory and kingship,
that all peoples, nations, and languages
    should serve him.
His dominion is an everlasting dominion
    that shall not pass away,
and his kingship is one
    that shall never be destroyed.

Daniel’s Visions Interpreted
15 As for me, Daniel, my spirit was troubled within me,[g] and the visions of my head terrified me. 16 I approached one of the attendants to ask him the truth concerning all this. So he said that he would disclose to me the interpretation of the matter: 17 “As for these four great beasts, four kings shall arise out of the earth. 18 But the holy ones of the Most High shall receive the kingdom and possess the kingdom forever—forever and ever.”

19 Then I desired to know the truth concerning the fourth beast, which was different from all the rest, exceedingly terrifying, with its teeth of iron and claws of bronze, and which devoured and broke in pieces, and stamped what was left with its feet; 20 and concerning the ten horns that were on its head, and concerning the other horn, which came up and to make room for which three of them fell out—the horn that had eyes and a mouth that spoke arrogantly, and that seemed greater than the others. 21 As I looked, this horn made war with the holy ones and was prevailing over them, 22 until the Ancient One[h] came; then judgment was given for the holy ones of the Most High, and the time arrived when the holy ones gained possession of the kingdom.

23 This is what he said: “As for the fourth beast,

there shall be a fourth kingdom on earth
    that shall be different from all the other kingdoms;
it shall devour the whole earth,
    and trample it down, and break it to pieces.
24 As for the ten horns,
out of this kingdom ten kings shall arise,
    and another shall arise after them.
This one shall be different from the former ones,
    and shall put down three kings.
25 He shall speak words against the Most High,
    shall wear out the holy ones of the Most High,
    and shall attempt to change the sacred seasons and the law;
and they shall be given into his power
    for a time, two times,[i] and half a time.
26 Then the court shall sit in judgment,
    and his dominion shall be taken away,
    to be consumed and totally destroyed.
27 The kingship and dominion
    and the greatness of the kingdoms under the whole heaven
    shall be given to the people of the holy ones of the Most High;
their kingdom shall be an everlasting kingdom,
    and all dominions shall serve and obey them.”

28 Here the account ends. As for me, Daniel, my thoughts greatly terrified me, and my face turned pale; but I kept the matter in my mind.",6qmj5mhDwJQ

2055,I didn't hate the movie.  It definitely didn't live up to this HYPE trailer though.  Can you imagine going back in time and showing this to an audience who had just seen the original?

If you look at the film it has insane number of action sequences and top production values. A few dodgy cg effects but hey 1997, cmon.

I'm only here because the Lord is coming back soon to judge the world. It is not His will that any perish but all repent to receive eternal life. I'm in oneness with His will. 

Everyday people die and enter hell, these are your friends and family. You have the voice to change their eternal destination if you follow and obey Jesus Christ until the end, and even unto death. Seek Him with patience and persistence, until you hear His voice, if your willing. Nothing is forced but if your friends and family end up in hell for all eternity, who can you blame? You have the voice to do right but you chose to do wrong.

God gave us freewill, nothing is forced. But for those who are willing, come and join the only kingdom that will last forever, the kingdom of Jesus Christ. All other kingdoms will perish by fire.

2 Peter 3:10
But the day of the Lord will come like a thief. The heavens will disappear with a roar; the elements will be destroyed by fire, and the earth and everything done in it will be laid bare.

2178,love this super awesome and stunning movie. An instant cult classic with an atmosphere to go along with it. One of my favorite movies in my collection. With awesome script stunning cast list and crew. Acted beyond reality and set in a franchise dating back a few years which gives real clarity to the presentation. Directed by academy and Oscar winning director Ridley Scott. And adapted to all those Sony Dolby compatible home entertainment products and Alien branded software systems.

2243,"From Rotten Tomatoes: 

The screenplay for How Do You Know is abysmal. 

There has never been a romantic comedy script where every scene contained an argument, and every single character said no, over and over again. 

I got a screener of How Do You Know, the rom-com with Reese Witherspoon and Owen Wilson. I watched it, and nearly self-immolated with boredom. It was so excruciatingly unfunny, and so carelessly written, that with a price tag of $120 million, I decided to do a study of the film's dialogue. 

Here's a list of VERBATIM quotes that I wrote down on second viewing. Prepare to be shocked. 

""DON'T DO X"" (Where one character tells the other not to do something and it shuts down the fun in the scene. Or where one character reveals that they themselves DIDN'T do something we want to see. (After the character reveals what hasn't been done, the scene comes to a screeching halt, as the actors, the director and the audience realize that nothing is happening. ""Don't forget your pants!"" I'd rather see Owen Wilson without his pants, thank you. 

PS: If a line is listed more than once, that means that the careless screenwriter inadvertently left multiple instances of the ""Don't"" line in his script, spoken by different characters in different scenes! FUCKING A W F U L. 

Do not beat yourself over the head. 
Don't let what's going on with you be an excuse to give me a hard time. 
Don't listen to me when I'm drinking Guinness. 
Don't tell me anything. 
Don't use that language in front of ... 
Don't want you to think that I am. 
Don't worry about it. 
Don't worry about it. 
Don't, don't tell me. I'm not going to take on anything I can't do. 
Don't, that's the thing about a good idea you don't have to think about it. 
I didn't want to... 
I don't follow you. You know, first things first. 
I don't have one. 
We don't have time for that. 
Why don't you shut up. Why do you look at me like I'm... 
You don't drink at all? 
You don't have to bring me food. 
You don't have to take me, thank you though. 
You don't make one important life decisions when you are mush. 
You don't remember Wednesday night? 
You don't want to eat anything? 
Did you say something, I was distracted. No. I'm not hungry 

The ""I Don't Know"" style of writing, where none of the characters knows anything, even though the audience has figured it out five minutes ago. In my book, a screenplay should have only one or two ""I don't knows"" saved for the soul searching in Act III. 
I didn't know about the groceries. 
I didn't know the cat was going to die. 
I don't know if I have what it takes. 
I don't know if the company will pay. 
I don't know if what we have is anything breakable. 
I don't know what to say and it makes me feel stupid. 
I don't know what's gotten into me this morning. 
I don't know. I'm not going to ask you where you are. 
I don't think that's how I'm feeling. 
I don't understand your failure to call back. 
I don't understand. 
I'm not sure how to further identify myself. 
I'm not sure, I forget. 
I'm not, I'm not saying she was with you. I'm not saying that. 
It doesn't matter where I am. 
She didn't know I was seeing someone. 
She didn't know it had escalated a bit. 
You aren't going to say anything? No. 

TONS OF EXPOSITORY QUESTIONS (Who are you, where are we? Why are we doing this? I mean, really? These are all fucking exact quotes from this awful movie. Even the freaking movie title is a question! Ug!) 

And is it possible for you not to control the outcome? No. 
Any new thoughts? No, not yet. Not at this precise moment. 
Are you okay? 
Are you okay? 
Are you sure? Well, no. 
Are you there? Barely. 
Can I call you later? 
Did I interrupt you? No. You sure haven't let anything take 
How are you doing? 
How are you doing? How are you doing? 
What am I doing? 
What do you want us to do? 
What you know about this? ""Nothing."" 
What's going on? ""Nothing."" 
Why are you here? 

THE ""JUST GO AWAY"" COMEDY TRAP (This trap involves one character screaming at the other ""Go Away"" because the writer thinks anger is reallllly funny, and because the only way to advance the plot is by having a breakup.) 

Either back the hell off or do what you've always done for me. 
Get out of here. 
Get out of here. I can't believe you're telling me all you just did. 
Grow up. No. 
I need you to go. 
I think I should go. 
I think you should get away from me. Cut me off. 
And I have to get going. 
If you're not back in an hour, forget it. 
I'm leaving and I'm not going to do this again. 
I'm sorry, I'm going to go. This is stupid. 


JUST SAY NO (For novice screenwriters, saying no and disagreeing are realllly hilarious. Until the audience realizes that five minutes have passed and absolutely nothing has taken place but an argument that's hard on the ears.) This is an extraordinary amount of NO's in a single screenplay. No? :) 

All in no, no, no, it's me being classy. No. No. No. 
Changing the channel: no, no, no, no. 
I'm not giving you a hard time, it's the same word for women. 
I'm not good today. 
I'm not looking for permission to drink. 
I'm in awe of y---. N, no, no, no, you can't! Don't break up with me. 
No hard feelings, I can't do this right now. 
No, not answering the phone. 
(There's) no trap. 
No, cooking relaxes me. 
No, I am not. 
No, I have one, I'm just not proud of it. 
No, I wasn't going to set the time 
No, no one is, though. 
No, no, no, no. 
No, no, you know, I think you're saying exactly what you can... 
No, you don't have to wear that dress home. 
No. 
No. 
No. Don't do that. 
Not a problem. 
Not doing anything wrong is what's keeping it.... 
Not for me. 
Not from my perspective. 
Not today. 
Not tonight. 
Taxi? No. 
(No.) I have a date. 
And can you just give me a minute to form a thought? 
And it's not like you're going to abuse the privilege. 
And no, no, so he stopped when his anger went away. 
And nobody is going to change his mind. 
And none for me. 
Can't handle it. 
Could you not,... I have a boyfriend. 
Did you ever want to delete every sentence you're saying? No. 
Do not assume, do not trust anyone. 
Do you know the picture? (Kramer vs. Kramer) No. 
Do you want to come? No, no. 
Don't feel funny talking to me. 
Don't feel sad for me. 
Don't go out of your way. No no no. 
Don't miss the team bus. 
Forget it. I said forget it. 
Hold on a minute. No. 
I am nothing like a wild man I used to be. 

I CAN'T, I WON'T, I DON'T (Ugh, just say yes and get to the fun part. The arguing is just fucking excruciating to listen to.) 
I can't take money from your father. 
I can't tell you ""what"". Because of that thing at work. 
I can't trust myself not to manipulate you. I don't know if... 
I can't. 
I didn't think it would ever touch you. 
I don't want our relationship become... 
I don't want to be in the way, that I feel like... 
I don't want to eat right now. 
I don't want to lie down. And I don't want to sit. 
I don't want to mislead you. 
I don't want you to ask me what's wrong. 
I don't want you to feel sorry for me. 
I don't, I got caught. 


I'M SORRY, I NEVER (My God, look at the negative statements in this screenplay!) 
I haven't had anything since lunch yesterday. 
I haven't packed yet. My phone is dead. 
I hope I haven't built this up too much. 
I hope it's not too late to call. No. 
I just didn't think it was right not to phone you. 
I mean not this time... 
I might have to go back on what I said about finally seeing... 
I never lived with anyone before. I don't want to figure this.. 
I never talk about myself. 
I shouldn't drink. No no no no, two nights in a row would be a... 
I think I just made a very bad assumption that we've been on 
I think they're pretending. 
I thought it wasn't supposed to. 
I wish there were some way I could tell you... 
Ignore it. 
I'll wait until you get here. 
I'm gone. No. You have to respect me on this. No. 
I'm not thinking about you. 
I'm sorry I'm not even aware of myself. 
I'm sorry, I'm going to go. This is stupid. 
I'm sorry, this is private. 
in I wanted to tell you not to worry. 
Is that it? 
It's best not to contact you until I'm clear on what to do. 
It's hard not to yell. 
It's just as well, it wasn't going to go well from there. (This is the worst line in the screenplay. Reese says this. Literally, ""It's just as WELL, it wasn't going to go WELL from there."" Really? Two ""Wells""? FUCKING AWFUL. 
It's too late for tonight. No, not at all. 
I've got a problem with that attitude. 
I've never felt that love. 
Just not too strong. 
Let me finish. No. 
Listen, I can't see her right now. 
Maybe it will help, maybe it won't, I'm trying. I'm sorry. No... 
Maybe we shouldn't talk. I wish we could just watch some TV or... 
My biggest fear is that you won't be yourselves around me. 
Never drink to feel better. 
Not when you say it like that. 
Please don't hit me. 
I'm a little too pissed off to say hello. 
Sorry for interrupting your day. 
Sorry sir, I wasn't able to contact him for you. 
That didn't come out at all well. 
That's why I didn't come forward. 
The baby thing? Never. 
The board is refusing to pay your legal bills. 
The firm is refusing to pay my legal bills. 
Then just tell me, I'd rather leave the rest of the night 
They don't have to say. 
They're directing people not to talk to me? 
This is such a mistake. 
This might not be the first the best first impression. 
We are not well matched. 
Yeah and you can't do this. You have a guest. 
You a relative of Andy's? No. 
You couldn't function if you knew the stuff I'm talking about. 
You do not have the luxury of not hearing this. (Ugh!) 
You ever wish you could delete everything you said as soon as you say it? 
You never ask. 
You wanted flowers? No. 
Your spirit. No. 
You're leaving, which is also hard. 
You're not asking... 
Be quiet for the whole dinner. Completely quiet. 
Cut it out, I don't understand what you're doing.. 
Cut it out. I have a boyfriend.

2250,Ya'll have to watch the bollywood 'remake' of this movie its so much better and newer. It has loads more action and it makes more sense!

2405,Most action packed Bond movie ever made!,eqrk7-mx2D0
2406,"0:37 Wow, Pierce Brosnan's pose there looks similar to that of Roger Moore's second gunbarrel pose used from The Spy Who Loved Me to A View to a Kill. Did Brosnan shoot that for this trailer or was it an alternative take during GoldenEye? If it was shot during Tomorrow Never Dies, I wonder why they didn't use that instead of reusing Brosnan's GoldenEye pose. Not that I have a problem with Brosnan's pose used in all 4 films. I guess they wanted to keep the tradition of reusing the same gunbarrel from the previous film. A tradition they would later abandon with Daniel Craig's Bond films.",eqrk7-mx2D0

I decided to rent the dvd from Hollywood Video. Then, I purchased a portable  DVD player and decided to watch lord of the Rings under the covers.  I felt like I was in another world when I watched this movie.  I felt like this movie took all the stressors from me as an adult.  Sound of music took the stressors from me when I was a child.

As the movie goes on the stakes get higher and the movie gets more exciting. Its a fun adventure that you cant help but enjoy. Not to mention that the comedy is so cheesy that its actually. The highlight of the movie is when Fogg is in San Francisco, where was just robbed. As you this man in despair thinking that he will never fulfill his dream, find the woman he loves, and win the bet. At that time when he has fallen into the most low moment in his life, he is found by his best friend and his love interest. They proved him that  man with a dream so big can not do that much alone. Even at his worst he discovers how much he means to those people. Even at his lowest he has already traveled a distance in a period that no man has ever done before. And when you see how thousands of americans believe in him that he could do what no man had done before that is the greatest moment of this film.

Someone I could trust. She'd never been with anyone before. We held hands after this movie. Even that was new for her. The song, the movie, everything felt like renewal. Starting life again, with hope. We ended up being together for 5 and a half years... before a pulmonary embolism out of nowhere claimed her life. She was barely into her thirties. This trailer fills me with unbelievable bittersweet love and sadness all at once, for the beauty that once was and I'll never see again.",uNJPSc_4RCI
2866,"I walked out of this movie. Only time I have ever done that in my entire life. Dear God, I even watched all of Delgo but could not make it through this.  Was so looking forward to it at the time but found it soooooooooooooooooo slow moving and depressing.  I get that there was deeper meaning bla, bla, bla, which I usually am very attracted to but it DIDN'T pull that part off. Literally the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. Maybe if my childhood had been screwed up I might have really been into it but because I had a great childhood this was torture.",uNJPSc_4RCI

2970,"I am still watching this movie in 2018 and it's still a great one. I do not care if people say that this movie is not related to DC Comics...it's NOT even supposed to be! This movie talks about a woman who never stood up for herself and was shy. The cat changed her life. People should take this movie otherwise. This movie shows us that even if people try to put us down we have to be strong and fight. BTW this movie is about the Goddess Bastet and the ancient Egyptian cat Mau  and so again this goddess is not related to DC. 

In one scene when the old woman pushes Patience, she throws some papers on the ground next to her. You can see in one of them the picture of Michelle Pfeiffer and the old woman saying: ""This cat saved many lives before. (or something like that)"" This meaning that Selina Kyle was saved by that cat like Patience. And that means that this cat has some powers and could change the life of many others, of course, those that are worth of it. For example, in the Michelle Pfeiffer movie you could see her giving milk to some cats when she wasn't transformed yet, and in the Halle Berry one you could see her climbing outside her window to rescue that cat. Those women showed respect to the cats and in exchange the cat changed their lives.

So...I do not care if some people hate this movie, I personally like it, because as I said before I do not care that the movie is not from DC...I see the message in it, meaning that we should be strong and not let anyone hurt us or take control of us.",d6pJbjbRnAA

3021,"The black magic has remained in tact through the art of family. They were placed in such tight nit communities that the magic was never lost when colonizers stole them from Africa, then bringing them to North America as slaves. Though their tribes, customs and traditions were lost, they still carried the pebble stone of life, family along with them in the shadow communities they were caged into. Restricted from human rights, the black magic was forced to do none other than learn. Watch. Watch again. Watch until you understood how to do it perfectly. And while the black magic watched, the colonizers continued each generation, growing further and further into darkness. 
So the black magic did just that. They did everything better in the world they were slaved into. By oppressing African Americans, but ignorantly allowing the black magic to survive they created the best of the best. Forced to learn how to live like their oppressors. And from then on came are what to be the Black Panthers. Marching in Numbers, and in Riots, they marked a wedge in the systamatic system the colonizers created. They begun building a ladder to be climbed on the oppression the colonizers placed on magic people. Black people are what have proven the colonizers way of life is wrong.
They are the army the original people of turtle Island need to regain peace and harmony.",SQvPRb4HADE

3100,"2003 was a strange oscars year. i could never understand why DDL didn't win. nor why on his last project thisyr, he didn't either. i guess he could go home, not surprised again bc well even tho Dafoe was my no2 option. I still think DDL shouldv won on his final movie. It sucks that he's retired from acting. ALOT of my heroes are either way too old for parts or they just don't have it in them anymore. I remember when Sean Connery retired, yet ChristopherPlummer &Betty White are older than him and still going strong. I saw Plummer reunite with Andrews again on Oprah's special. W0W just W0W man. OMG what am I going to do without DDL in Hollywood. this new generation would be lost without him. I guess with all the method acting he does with the roles he picks, serious or not. DDL was &still is one of a kind. ofc once your fave hit pass 80-90 its a miracle they're still working. KirkDouglas is the exception he lived pass 100yo. Still a legend. I miss him too.",qHVUPri5tjA

3327,"Initially, the first sequel to Toy Story was going to be a direct-to-video release, with development beginning in 1996. However, after the cast from Toy Story returned and the story was considered to be better than that of a direct-to-video release, it was announced in 1998 that the sequel would see a theatrical release while working on A Bugs' Life. 

Toy Story's first sequel Toy Story 2 was released in theatres November 24, 1999 and saw the return of the majority of the voice cast from Toy Story, and the film focuses on Buzz leading Andy's toys on a mission to rescue Woody after he is stolen by a greedy toy collector voiced by Wayne Knight. The film was equally well received by critics, many of whom thought it was even better than the first installment, earning a rare 100% approval rating at Rotten Tomatoes, based on 163 reviews. At Metacritic, the film earned a favorable rating of 88/100 based on 34 reviews. The film's widest release was 3,257 theaters and it grossed $485 million worldwide, becoming the second-most successful animated film after The Lion King at the time of its release.",Lu0sotERXhI

1) when she was traveling through the wormhole , her face splits into two and the second face which looks blurry says these words "" i had no idea"" and ""they are alive"". these are the exact same words that she says later on in the movie. when she see their city with all lights and everything from the space she says "" they are alive"" and when she looks at the yellow galaxy and admire its beauty he says they must have sent a poet to describe the beauty if what she witnesses  and they she says "" i had no idea ""   my question is how did this happen ? what does it mean ? does it mean whatever happened to her already happened to her in the future ? is she re living the moment ? does it mean what ever is happening is all pre fixed ? and there is nothing called free will ? 

2) during the encounter with the alien , it bends down and picks up the sand from the beach and in the scene you can spot 6 stars appearing in the form of semi circle in the palm of the alien. and the same things appears an the end of the movie to ellie when she picks up the sand where she was sitting in the desert gassing at the valley. what does this mean ? during her 18 hour presence in the other dimension or whatever it is, they have altered her gene or something ?

3706,"By far the best F&F film to date. However...i have to say, I am really impressed with the fact that a franchise can make 8+ movies, and *_still_* not only are thry on the big screen, but most of them are pretty damn good...some are okay and some are great. But the way they keep it all going with the plot twists, almost always different plotlines, bringing in new celebrity actors for almost every new film (Dwayne Johnson, Kurt Russell, Charlize Theron, female UFC fighters such as Ronda Rousey 👈LoL!!), all while keeping the same, original crew together after 17+ years. Now *_THAT_* is impressive. I don't care what anyone says.
People are so accustomed to and used to a movie franchise that has so many sequels (Friday The 13th, Halloween, Saw, Star Wars, The Alien Franchise, Final Destination, Jaws, i could go on all day) to automatically just being really really bad and not worth watching. And in their defense, most of them are pretty awful, and also are usually so bad they go straight to DvD (Think: Child's Play). 
So anyway, when someone goes into a movie with the frame of mind that it's going to be really bad, well, it usually is because they have that frame of mind for the entire film. Usually just waiting for it to take that hard left turn. Which it usually does. But when it turns out to be really good, they might think ""well, this wasnt bad at all"" but since they had that frame of mind for the entire film, it's almost impossible for them to forget all about the fact that you thought it would suck, and you can't really enjoy it as much as you could have, had you gone into the movie with an open mind, or thinking that it just might be good.
   So anyway, this post is long, sorry. To the point...
If you go back and re-watch ANY of these sequels that you thought were bad or ""would be"" bad, and you make yourself think they are going to be really great, then you will certainly enjoy it more, and also you will probably like it. 
  It's all a psychological thing and it really works. 
Just a brief example: way back when, I was just a kid and went to see 'Titanic' in the theater. I really disliked that type of movie as a kid, like most kids do. And initially didnt want to see it. But eventually i heard from several people, all over school, all over the tv, how amazing it was, and how everyone wants to see it again, etc. 
When i saw it, I liked it a lot. However, about 5 years ago I watched it again. Surprisingly i hadnt seen it since i was about 14 so i forgot most of it. Anyway, i didnt like it much at all and was curious as to why i liked such a film *_more_* at 14 than as an adult? It should've been the other way around. 
But again, it's all a psychological thing and bcuz i went into the theater with the mindset that it was a great movie. So i really actually enjoyed it at the time. 
   Anyway, thats something i learnes in college about how the mind works and can sometimes play tricks on you. Making you actually think and believe what you want to, and how easily it can happen. Very, very interesting topic.

3971,"What I remember about this movie - really, the only thing I remember - was the scene where he is in the hospital bed, smoking and drinking.  That scene summed it all up :  He refused to stop living, even when they told him it would kill him.  .. You gotta live, else what's the point of being alive - I thought was the message.  .. I did not get that from watching Dead Poets Society, which I thought was boring as hell, and could not watch to the end.  Carpe Diem - seize the day.. uh-huh, ok.. whatever.. Funny though, how I do not remember the rest of this film.  Maybe because the rest simply led up to that moment?  ""He won't quit""... that's what stayed with me. Maybe I should watch it again?  But it may not be as , have the same affect, as the first time.. I fear.  But what I got, I got, and would rather hold on to.",C74Pae3PpMo

4088,"Awesome fiction movie, great effect and trama, but, hey police there is trouble with your stats and values.... for some reason someone make a clon of you to replace you or screw your reputation, on the movie you don't look to have family troubles but the ones on pursuit were they not you!!!! I may take the risk to say that someone above her was trying to protect you or to calm her down for past issues or an stupidity on your present.... Looks like she doesn't even notice or don't even care about the switch. So if that was the case she may be the one on trouble and was a coward by not confessing you and preffer that somebody try to erase your mind and life before you may find out the real problem, and practicly let you at the edge of nothing fighting for what did I did wrong and who that fuck are they? You appear to have a normal life, a normal family, a normal job and a normal future as the rest of the families around you, but they don't look to have a normal job or even a normal future!!!! And looks like the one that they have completely study was to her not to you, which give me the bad felling that she was messing with the wrong guys and appearing to have a normal life, like on the movie true lies. 
So, if she was messing with wrong guys with technology, she may be able to know staff that maybe you were hiding and maybe she took advantage and screw it a was unable to get rib of it, which means she screw her self and her family by playing with the wrong toys!!!! On an avengers (advantageous) world there is a problem "" you use advantage and you suicide your self "" you will never be release, except break the blocks!!!! Otherwise die paying the debts. So, we don't know if they make a favor or screw you. What we understand is that the doctor was like trying like to know what you knew but looks like they were already on troubles so it looks like your wife wasn't the only one with advantage, so we may recommend that you fight for your kids and let her try to break them, you may be defending what it hurt you and that's not reciprocity on the normal world!!!!!!

And I didn’t understand how could they go to Chiang Mai and back to Bangkok by a small truck for an hour? That’s 700 km. away!!!

4318,"I've noticed something interesting... in every movie that has acted by Robin William's there seems to be a part of his life that is subtly embedded within the script.
Several examples:
Mrs.. Doubtfire: Divorce. (Robin Williams went through a major divorce).
Hook: Childhood. (Robin Williams said in an interview that he was a lot like Jack, in that, he wanted to spend time with his father who was always busy).
Flubber: Work-Life balance issues. (Robin Williams expressed in many interviews that he felt his life was predominated by Hollywood, but that he loved bringing joy in his performance, and that acting is his passion).",dl4r6JK6vgY

Well before the numbers were in for it's first weekend, I accurately predicted The Last Jedi would fail to clear $1.5Bn at the box office.

Also, Orlando Jones, Jeremy Irons and Guy Pearce were the only actors that were carrying the weight of this film.  If you took these actors out of the film, then this film would absolutely be garbage.  Also, this film has little to do with the book by HG Wells.  in fact, the original time machine film was closer to the book.

4613,"I re-watched this a year or so ago and, (trying to ignore the book,) rated it poor, but interesting. Most books are better than the film version but even as a film, (or short serial,) this should have been better.
    There is more than enough in this book to make a short high quality serial. It could be modestly expanded without harm to make maybe 5-6 hour long episodes without ads'. Just don't let Americans make it or it'll be dragged out into three seasons of poor, diluted rot. 
    For clarity I am not saying Americans do not make good TV,  just that if anything is good, or rather popular, it tends to be pushed on and on way past its natural end. That's when quality drops.

4625,"Didn't know this movie was around 3 hours long . Is an okay-ish movie as many post apocalyptic movies were in the 70's, 80's and 90's they were all with the same lingo .

I'm not a Kevin Costner fan , i don't know but he doesn't deliver that great emotion or that touch in acting like other actors do from the same age as him . Only movie that i liked with Kevin Costner was The Untouchables but maybe because there were two bigger actors that i love more which are Robert deNiro and Sean Connery . 

Waterworld was nothing exceptionnal as movie it was a remake from Mad Max but this time on Sea , still don't know why that movie was so expensive to be made?? The vilain played by Dennis Hopper was cartoonish and funny . Not a bad movie but surely not a blockbuster either , it's a good little b-movie to watch without being too serious .

Dances with Wolves many people call it a masterpiece but for me maybe because i'm not American that movie was boring and could have been easily shortened done to a less than 2 hours movie than more than 3 hours also there were too much scenes were nothing really happened only showing us for several seconds and minutes the sky, forest, water , etc.... Movies like these are good to watch only one time in our life .

Robin Hood : Prince of Thieves is badly and poorly executed it also showed that mixing era's was bad, what has the character played by Morgan Freeman to do with a Robin Hood story ?! is beyond me . The only great interpretation was for the vilain Alan Rickman was the only good thing in the whole movie . Give me Robin Hood with Erol Flynn over this sh*t .

Kevin Costner is not my cup of tea as actor . my opinion .",BC8FxxvXYTY

4840,"This was my favorite of the series by far. Although I definitely have some criticisms.

Eddie Carr was my absolute favorite character right from the moment he was introduced. He was a weapon and tech expert, and he had all the characteristics I would normally root for. Plus when Nick and Sara (mostly Nick) make the dumbest decision in this entire series besides Ken Wheatley, when they bring back a baby T-Rex hoping to bandage its broken leg. This of course gets them nearly thrown off a cliff, leaving them suspended in midair. After this happens, Eddie being the awesome guy that he is, immediately goes to save them. He ties a rope to a tree and tosses it to the group, singlehandedly saving their lives. He then hops into the Gatherer and tries to pull them up with a cable attached to the Mobile Lab, which actually starts to work. So after singlehandedly saving his team from certain death, what does Eddie get for his troubles? Snatched from the front seat of the Gatherer and brutally ripped in half by two T-Reyes. Not only that, but in the first death of the movie.

Really wish they had done more with that character.",RxrvaneULkE

Oh yeah, the Inspector Gadget figure that you had to collect ALL the pieces for? Yeah, well there was a Taco Bell commercial for other toys, but they pulled the plug on it. The commercial showed a CGI animated version of Gidget the Chihuahua, the last time you ever see the dog before some stereotype act occurred. I can't find it anywhere, mostly because it was probably an accident and was a commercial for toys that never got produced. I just remember it and I know I'm not crazy, maybe WB aired it by mistake and I saw it? They also used Brain the Beagle from the movie in the commercial, which Gidget tried to talk to Brain but Brain turned his head away from Gidget. Well I guess I saw something strange, I could be crazy which I remember it very well. The last thing I would like to note is, the commercial was aired far after the movie was released on VHS. I just think WB had some prototype commercial in the line-up, then they noticed and remove it from the air.

5250,"This movie is amazing Mel Gibson is a fantastic actor and director. Mel takes the character of William Wallace and does a great job. This is probably one of the most beloved movies in cinema history, especially the speech he gives at one of the major battles ""They can take our lives, but they will not take our freedom.""  What a powerful scene and the most remembered. This is almost a three-hour film but it does not feel like it because you are so engaged with it. The locations they picked just made the movie that more authentic, hey if you are going to make a movie about a Scotsman do it in Scotland. I'm pretty sure almost everyone saw this movie so this won't be a spoiler but I was so upset that he died but when he denied the king mercy and said freedom even though you know he will die you still root for him. Patrick McGoohan who plays Longshanks the king is a threatening and menace presence and he does a fantastic job at it and you hate that character with a purple passion. There is not a single thing wrong with this movie. The acting is amazing, the story is amazing, directing is amazing and the music is amazing. I'm so glad that Mel directed this movie because he knew what he wanted and if it was someone else we would not have gotten this masterpiece. there is a reason why it won so many awards. And Catherine McCormack who plays his wife was excellent and so was and Angus McFayden who played Robert the Bruce was excellent too.  If you have not seen this movie then I recommend you do.

5374,"A running gag throughout the series is Plankton's many attempts to obtain the Krabby Patty formula as a means to attract customers to his restaurant, the Chum Bucket, usually through disguise and deceit. All of said attempts have failed, usually ending with Mr. Krabs throwing him back to the Chum Bucket or snatching the bottle out of his hands. 
The secret formula plays an essential role in the plotlines for the two movies adaptations of the series. In them, Plankton devises numerous ways to steal the formula as he does in many episodes in the series. In the second movie, it is Burger-Beard the Pirate who attempts and succeeds to steal the secret formula in order to set up his own fast-food business on land.",e9awLSibQ80

5560,"Dracula is a symbolic metaphor of the Jew. He is a rich stranger who hates Christ and the crucifix. He lives in the dark and filth. He has an Eastern European accent, drinks blood, corrupts women and cannot bear to see his own reflection in a mirror. Also of note is the six-sided star he wears around his neck. Jews are greedy and wealthy, hate Christ and the cross, are always strangers and foreigners in the land of the goyim, usually have accents from European nations (at least Ashkenazi kikes do). They drink foreskin blood and the blood of Christian babies at Passover and Purim which is well documented throughout history from confessions of Jews who have done this abomination. Jews also are leeches who live off the lifeblood of a host nation via taxes, usury and deceptive philosophical positions in high authority positions to transfer wealth and power to their own people. Jews are behind feminism, abortion and the profligation of pornography, homosexuality, abortion and every other sexually deviant act which massively affects the corruption of women. Jews kidnap Russian and Ukrainian women and bring them to Israel where they have impunity from human trafficking laws. Jews have raped Gentile women throughout history and intermarried with royality to corrupt the blood and soul of a woman from her people. Jews cannot bear even one jot or tittle of honest and sincere criticism because they will call you an anti-Semite, holocaust denier, Nazi, klansman and a racist if you even look at them the wrong way or say they did something wrong. Last but not least is the so-called Star of David which the Jews have on the flag of Israel and their synagogues which is really a hexagram, a magical symbol used in Kabbalah with six points, six triangles and six planes of a hexagon inside (666). It is the star of their god Remphan as mentioned in the Bible. Maybe Bram Stoker, Bela Legosi and Eastern European peasants were trying to warn us of the nature of the Jew with the folk tale of the vampire. Sounds legit.",_2aWqecTTuE

5645,"A true sci-fi masterpiece.  Pure class.  Love the story. The action scenes are great. Nice visuals, and great soundtrack. that suits the visuals. I like how the actors play the characters too. Like theyre doped-up, content, conditioned and dumbed down, docile and accepting of life/existence as dictated and arranged by the corporations. Caan plays the strong silent-type well and you don't see any feeling or emotion on James Caan's face right up until the very last scene when he beats the game/corporation  and skates round the track towards the camera.  The ending of the movie really gets you going.

We got some awesome sci-fi movies back in the 60's, 70's and 80's.   Rare to get a good one now.  Sci-fi movies now rely too heavily on cgi overload to wow the audience. I think everyone including modern audiences are growing tired of cgi overload and no substance. Movies today seem to be aimed at everyone. So you end up with weak movies that everyone thinks are okay, but they don't actually wow any individual group of people in particular",aVUxK1mNups

There's a great cast Antonio Banderas i have always find him an underrated actor , Lucy Liu is great has her moments .

The Vilain looks like a John Travolta-ish but is good .

Then the explosions like a Michael Bay movie lol and so great car chases . Whatelse do you need more?

That said, we felt the debut to be flat. It’s going to be difficult to warm up to the ‘replacements’ but we are open. The new Mandy did give us a few laughs. We’ll see how she integrates into the show. Maybe they should have made her a character only spoken about like they do in Frazier with Niles wife, Maris.

Maybe I don't understand the criticism because I haven't read the novel but come on. This movie is entertaining. It delivers its plot in a clear cut and nicely flowing manner. It isn't just mindless action and talking heads. Plus its able to convey the emotions of the victims of the invasion and how people are being affected by it. 

Maybe people hate the movie because it isnt exactly like Stephen Kings book to the exact detail, which is incredibly unfair to the medium. If everything was like the book the movie would be hours upon hours",FaAtvjev_So

5938,"I wish I could love Abraham Lincoln a man and for the true person he is, but he hurt a lot of people, especially women in the process! I understand like any man, Abraham Lincoln isn't perfect, but in his humanity and behavior, he had issues he didn't seem to want to fix of his own, and to me, that will never be forgotten since he was too proud to change it, and that's something that can make women feel very emotional and heartbroken for of him, and I feel sorry for the hearts of women he broke at the time. Maybe the grief of faithlessness from Lincoln's wife could have been hard for Lincoln to put up with of her, but the big issue of Lincoln himself was his pride among anybody's pain. Abraham Lincoln was too proud and ambitious for fighting, which is why he could care less whatsoever for women's feelings!

5941,"I honestly don't think Abraham Lincoln is the best president of the United States because he was political and liked fighting. He may have been carelessly wreckless in his behavior he may have forgotten the importance of loving one another through everything the good and bad times, like not just showing faith and pride with one another when you're happy but also dedicate to sympathy for grief, sorrow, pain, and heartbreak when you or someone is sad, unhappy, or frustrated.",KJVuqYkI2jQ

It's actually a phenomenal story that takes an arguably absurd premise and effectively suspends disbelief. Ironically, it is the captivating performances by the four aging astronauts themselves that will effectively distract you from the subtle inconsistencies of the film, such as their low-budget approach to a zero gravity environment.

6067,Travers' motivation (beyond the money) did not make any sense to me. He would have had a pretty substantial government pension coming his way so why would he have went on a suicide mission with those fuck wits?! The terrorists even had the guy from EastEnders who had an affair with his step daughter in their team. The scene when Leon and Stallone have that fight in the cave has been criticized for being racist but all of the terrorists are deeply unsympathetic. There are no racial connations behind his threat to rape the girl. He wouldn't have had time. Why did the authorities take so long to scramble fighters to the area? John Lithgow is terrific and it is a very exciting action film but there are some glaring plot holes.,URdSD8UWxLk

I saw it back when I was a teenager around the time it came out, and that was the perfect age for it, given it's a lot sillier, broader and jokier than the first two.

6376,"I don't understand why the us is trying to assign the victory in the second world war myself, I certainly understand that the United States was also the loss of about 400,000 people and more but why is the us trying to overshadow the participation of the USSR in the second world war only when the almost three-year siege of Leningrad (St. Petersburg) killed about 1 million people of the Soviet Union with one city lost more people than the United States during the war you can imagine is in new York to the enemy isolated him from the country and the people in it died of hunger cold disease of banditry and attacks as it was in the USSR and Soviet losses were about 27millionov man and this figure is not final and the war was almost all over the Western part of the USSR just 
modern Americans do not know what a war of extermination on their land, they did not see this grief they were not taken to Germany as slaves not burned in ovens or in them same ranch the whole family and in the Soviet Union people from the village are herded together with their children in a barn and burned all together",oHvDBE5O09o

6380,"This movie is another of the many scoundrels of the US and Hollywood. The real action to capture the nazi Enigma machine, which took place in May 1941, was carried out by an English, not American, command as it appears in this film, among other reasons, because at that time the United States had not yet entered in the war.
In the book on which the film of Russell Crowe is based, The Farthest Coast, the pirate ship against which the English fight is not French, is American.
American political propaganda has no scruples about misrepresenting history, and adulterating literature, when this suits their political interests. On numerous occasions the US has fabricated ""incidents"" to justify their invasions or their bombings, false indeed. This has been revealed by their own documents once they were declassified.",oHvDBE5O09o

The Catholic Church ultimately resolved this question by declaring that the Easter Bunny orgasmed every time it laid it an egg (which it was doing constantly). This is now codified in Canon Law (the legal code of the Catholic Church and much of Europe in the pre-modern era) and saying that the Easter Bunny does not orgasm with every egg laid is considered blasphemy and grounds for excommunication from the Church.",VBR3jDS-Ad4

However, this is an amazing film. So beautifully shot and its an honest film that isn't too heavy on the religious aspect even though that does play a key aspect to the film. It is truly stunning in every manner and one you need to see if you have never watched it.",yWs81poMgiM
6511,"Besides the amazing and breath-taking soundtrack of the film, the true ending is much more disturbing, which makes me a bit glad that the movie had finished where it ended, other than it would frighten the children watching this movie, even though there are already many non-suitable scenes in the movie. For those of you who wouldn't know what happens right after Yocheved's echo ""deliever us"" , Moses realizes that his people have given up on the two men who have freed them from the Eygptian's grasp. Only because of their own stupidity and impatience for Moses to arrive after the message from God, on top of a mountain, which took him approximately a month and a half. When he came back down, he was fumed with anger, and threw the commandments upon a golden calf, made by Aaron (Moses' brother) which the Hebrews have decided to worship in place of Jesus Christ. God commanded that anyone who did not take God's side would be slain to death. This killed about 70% - 90%  of the Israelites that came from Egypt. As for the rest, they either died in the fourty walk in the desert and died off like everyone else would, leaving a very minimum amount of survivors. The golden calf was eventually burned in God's name. 

I'm not saying that slavery is a good thing, it's terrible. But if the Israelites had chosen to stay in Egypt with a controlling Pharoh, more than half of their lives would have been spared, and perhaps it wouldn't be as suffering as it would in the new land.",yWs81poMgiM

1. Traveling gives them bragging rights which in turn is a form a status signaling. Women are constantly trying to one up each other by moving up the pecking order, traveling to exotic and famous places is a big way to do that.

2. To escape responsibility. Visiting a foreign country gives women access to as much consequence free sex as they want without hurting their reputation back home. They can be whores without ruining their image.",mjay5vgIwt4

7060,"Jesus Christ is the son of God and he died on the cross to save you from your sins and rose from the dead so if you believe in him you shall not perish but have eternal life though him. We all have sinned and fall short to God's infinite glory. You can't save yourself from your own sins and no good works could save you, only God is able to save and forgive your sins and bring you into heaven. Those who don't put their faith in Jesus will continue to be spiritually dead, will go to hell and will have eternal separation from a holy God. But those who will have faith in Jesus will be given the Holy Spirit, who will make them spiritually alive, and will enter God's kingdom in heaven, where true love, peace and joy dwell. Now that I have the Holy Spirit, I experience the love and power of God everyday and it's beyond human understanding:) I use to be bad, I lied, stole, committed sexual immorality and other terrible things but I started to read the Bible and the more I read it, the more my heart and life began to change for the better. Out of the love, grace and mercy of God I'm saved from my sins, not because of anything I've done, I was deserving of punishment. God loves you very much and wants a relationship with you, your so special and important to him. God would never forsake you or leave you, he would always take care of you and remain faithful to you. God would comfort you in times of need and help you in any area of your life. God loves everyone equally but the love he has for you is like your the only thing in all existence that he loves. God would give you a purpose in this life and the life to come. This life in only temporary and goes by in a flash but the life you come is eternal. If you place your faith in Jesus Christ as your Lord and savior today, God will prove how big he really is. If you have questions or want me to pray for anything I'll always be here for you. Also I have a video called God loves all:message, if your interested. God bless you and I hope you have a great and wonderful rest of your year!:)",BLTnQko_Lz4

7127,"Wow. This may have been the most poorly advertised movie I ever seen. It's like MGM TRIED to keep people away from it. Making a Sci-Fi thriller feel like a ""light-hearted romp"" is not a good thing.",ZUdy0Cu3f_o

7146,"I find it a bit unsettling that this movie ended up meaning a great deal to me and my life and it was just a flop.

7295,"Easily the best most important and meaningful Rambo film of the series, with the most depth, character development, philosophical examination of spirituality and politics. This film perfectly shows the Soviet propaganda that was really widespread at the time. It is still chilling how authentic film this is, for some of us who were there know that this is what was going on. It also reflects back how propaganda is used against people again when they compare Mujahideen with Taliban today or Soviets with Russians today and then projecting it onto this film. This film merely shows back our own prejudices and beliefs influenced by the powers that be. Self projecting is strong with this one, that's what's making it such a powerful film.",bZemQdvthBs

Ellen Ripley started as a wet behind the ears warrant officer, to a grizzled alien killer, to a destitute survivor on a prison colony, everything she cared for, taken from her once again. 
Now she has to survive in this desolate place of human predators, while the ultimate predator pics them off one by one. 
One of the reasons I love this movie, is because it's a lesson, that the world isn't all sunshine and puppy dogs, it's brutal, twisted and you don't always get what you want. 


I think the ending is one of the best ever, everything she cared about is gone, and she can't let the corporation weaponize the alien, so she jumps  into the blast furnace, the alien bursts out, and she grabs it taking it with her. 

I thought it was sad, but an awesome way to end it.",KUTaNMJJBa8
7688,cant believe this was in 1992. i was born in 1997 and when i was about 8-9 i remember seeing this in tv so i thought it was release around that time... im about to watch the whole series im excited!,KUTaNMJJBa8
7689,This a good movie. But Aliens is scarier. This is better then A Nightmare on elm street. It is also better then A Nightmare on elm street 2 Freddy's revenge. But it is not has good has a Nightmare on elm street 3 the dream worries. But it is better then Friday the 13th. It is also better then Friday the 13th part II. But it is not has good has Friday the 13th part III. But it is better then Halloween. But it is not has good has the 1981 version of Halloween II. But it is a lot better then Halloween III season of the witch I like this movie. Do I not like Halloween III season of the witch.,KUTaNMJJBa8

7770,"A lot of people obviously don't know much about this film judging by the comments, but actually the film it really has similarities with is an earlier De Niro film called the King of Comedy. It was a very similar character - a loser with obsessive delusions (in The Fan it's about baseball, in the King of Comedy he's an aspiring comedian). The King of Comedy was very well received by critics, De Niro was applauded for his performance, but it was a box office bomb. 

So The Fan made a lot of sense at the time. It allowed De Niro to pick up that kind of performance again by playing a similar character, but this time it had a big budget, Wesley Snipes (who was a big star at the time) and a good cast. That was more or less the background and although it's nowhere near as good as The King of Comedy, it was still fairly entertaining due to De Niro's performance.",OJhwzOqqdqU

7858,"Kevin Spacey in the 1980s had a sexual relationship with a 14 year old. He was in his mid 20s..about 24 years old. Another man accused him of sexual misconduct when he too was around 14 years old. Since then Hollywood fired him from his well known show ""House of Cards"". He's even had police investigate these allegations about him. And now he is a disgrace in the film industry.  A couple months later ""Call me by Your Name"" gets nominated for a multitude of awards. The plot: a younger teen boy falls in love and even sleeps with a 24 year old... And wayyy before all this,  this movie (Lolita) was produced and made featuring a 14 year old actress doing suggestive scenes with an older male actor... ""Malena"" an Italian film features highly explicit scenes of a said 13 year old boy sleeping or doing sexual things with a woman (Monica Belluci).. The directors, producers and actors- none of them were reprimanded for these films depicting teens and young children in sexual situations with adults. But when we see Ol' Mr. So and So or people like Kevin Spacey down the street who is a registered or known sex offender/predator suddenly ""he shouldn't be alive"" because he's the ""scum of the earth""? The hypocrisy in humanity sometimes. We are in the end times for sure.",HzfLrEAhpzU

7865,The book was a metaphor for Russia and what the author (from Russia obviously) felt the communist did to 'her',HzfLrEAhpzU
7866,"A movie about a grown-ass man obsessed with a 14-year-old child (in the book she’s actually 12, but the director changed her age). Disgusting but amazing. A lot of people didn’t realize that Dolores isn’t the one who seduces Humbert, she’s just an abused little girl. The story is about Humbert’s point of view. He sees her in a sexual way, his sick mind brings him to think that the child is hot and wants to have him the same way he wants to have her. Did you notice Dolores cries multiple times in the movie? That’s because she’s depressed and tired to be his personal sex doll, but she has nowhere else to go. At some point, while she’s fighting with him, she even calls her mom while she cries. That can make you get that she’s just a child who feels lost and wants to have a normal life just like other kids of her age. She’s not happy with Humbert, feels like she’s trapped in a cage and wants to run away, and in fact she does it.",HzfLrEAhpzU
7867,"It’s not completely romantic it’s actually heartbreaking witnessing how Humbert is infatuated whilst Lolita is simply trying to survive. How he views it as a love story to triumph all odds whilst Lolita is a victim of his fantasy. This is hardly a romance & is arguably just as disturbing if it was narrated from her kidnapped point of view. 

I cried at the end when it all sunk in 💔.",HzfLrEAhpzU

Beloved
Plot Overview
Beloved begins in 1873 in Cincinnati, Ohio, where Sethe, a former slave, has been living with her eighteen-year-old daughter Denver. Sethe’s mother-in-law, Baby Suggs, lived with them until her death eight years earlier. Just before Baby Suggs’s death, Sethe’s two sons, Howard and Buglar, ran away. Sethe believes they fled because of the malevolent presence of an abusive ghost that has haunted their house at 124 Bluestone Road for years. Denver, however, likes the ghost, which everyone believes to be the spirit of her dead sister.

On the day the novel begins, Paul D, whom Sethe has not seen since they worked together on Mr. Garner’s Sweet Home plantation in Kentucky approximately twenty years earlier, stops by Sethe’s house. His presence resurrects memories that have lain buried in Sethe’s mind for almost two decades. From this point on, the story will unfold on two temporal planes. The present in Cincinnati constitutes one plane, while a series of events that took place around twenty years earlier, mostly in Kentucky, constitutes the other. This latter plane is accessed and described through the fragmented flashbacks of the major characters. Accordingly, we frequently read these flashbacks several times, sometimes from varying perspectives, with each successive narration of an event adding a little more information to the previous ones.
From these fragmented memories, the following story begins to emerge: Sethe, the protagonist, was born in the South to an African mother she never knew. When she is thirteen, she is sold to the Garners, who own Sweet Home and practice a comparatively benevolent kind of slavery. There, the other slaves, who are all men, lust after her but never touch her. Their names are Sixo, Paul D, Paul A, Paul F, and Halle. Sethe chooses to marry Halle, apparently in part because he has proven generous enough to buy his mother’s freedom by hiring himself out on the weekends. Together, Sethe and Halle have two sons, Howard and Buglar, as well as a baby daughter whose name we never learn. When she leaves Sweet Home, Sethe is also pregnant with a fourth child. After the eventual death of the proprietor, Mr. Garner, the widowed Mrs. Garner asks her sadistic, vehemently racist brother-in-law to help her run the farm. He is known to the slaves as schoolteacher, and his oppressive presence makes life on the plantation even more unbearable than it had been before. The slaves decide to run.
Schoolteacher and his nephews anticipate the slaves’ escape, however, and capture Paul D and Sixo. Schoolteacher kills Sixo and brings Paul D back to Sweet Home, where Paul D sees Sethe for what he believes will be the last time. She is still intent on running, having already sent her children ahead to her mother-in-law Baby Suggs’s house in Cincinnati. Invigorated by the recent capture, schoolteacher’s nephews seize Sethe in the barn and violate her, stealing the milk her body is storing for her infant daughter. Unbeknownst to Sethe, Halle is watching the event from a loft above her, where he lies frozen with horror. Afterward, Halle goes mad: Paul D sees him sitting by a churn with butter slathered all over his face. Paul D, meanwhile, is forced to suffer the indignity of wearing an iron bit in his mouth.
When schoolteacher finds out that Sethe has reported his and his nephews’ misdeeds to Mrs. Garner, he has her whipped severely, despite the fact that she is pregnant. Swollen and scarred, Sethe nevertheless runs away, but along the way she collapses from exhaustion in a forest. A white girl, Amy Denver, finds her and nurses her back to health. When Amy later helps Sethe deliver her baby in a boat, Sethe names this second daughter Denver after the girl who helped her. Sethe receives further help from Stamp Paid, who rows her across the Ohio River to Baby Suggs’s house. Baby Suggs cleans Sethe up before allowing her to see her three older children.
Sethe spends twenty-eight wonderful days in Cincinnati, where Baby Suggs serves as an unofficial preacher to the black community. On the last day, however, schoolteacher comes for Sethe to take her and her children back to Sweet Home. Rather than surrender her children to a life of dehumanizing slavery, she flees with them to the woodshed and tries to kill them. Only the third child, her older daughter, dies, her throat having been cut with a handsaw by Sethe. Sethe later arranges for the baby’s headstone to be carved with the word “Beloved.” The sheriff takes Sethe and Denver to jail, but a group of white abolitionists, led by the Bodwins, fights for her release. Sethe returns to the house at 124, where Baby Suggs has sunk into a deep depression. The community shuns the house, and the family continues to live in isolation.

Meanwhile, Paul D has endured torturous experiences in a chain gang in Georgia, where he was sent after trying to kill Brandywine, a slave owner to whom he was sold by schoolteacher. His traumatic experiences have caused him to lock away his memories, emotions, and ability to love in the “tin tobacco box” of his heart. One day, a fortuitous rainstorm allows Paul D and the other chain gang members to escape. He travels northward by following the blossoming spring flowers. Years later, he ends up on Sethe’s porch in Cincinnati.
Paul D’s arrival at 124 commences the series of events taking place in the present time frame. Prior to moving in, Paul D chases the house’s resident ghost away, which makes the already lonely Denver resent him from the start. Sethe and Paul D look forward to a promising future together, until one day, on their way home from a carnival, they encounter a strange young woman sleeping near the steps of 124. Most of the characters believe that the woman—who calls herself Beloved—is the embodied spirit of Sethe’s dead daughter, and the novel provides a wealth of evidence supporting this interpretation. Denver develops an obsessive attachment to Beloved, and Beloved’s attachment to Sethe is equally if not more intense. Paul D and Beloved hate each other, and Beloved controls Paul D by moving him around the house like a rag doll and by seducing him against his will.
When Paul D learns the story of Sethe’s “rough choice”—her infanticide—he leaves 124 and begins sleeping in the basement of the local church. In his absence, Sethe and Beloved’s relationship becomes more intense and exclusive. Beloved grows increasingly abusive, manipulative, and parasitic, and Sethe is obsessed with satisfying Beloved’s demands and making her understand why she murdered her. Worried by the way her mother is wasting away, Denver leaves the premises of 124 for the first time in twelve years in order to seek help from Lady Jones, her former teacher. The community provides the family with food and eventually organizes under the leadership of Ella, a woman who had worked on the Underground Railroad and helped with Sethe’s escape, in order to exorcise Beloved from 124. When they arrive at Sethe’s house, they see Sethe on the porch with Beloved, who stands smiling at them, naked and pregnant. Mr. Bodwin, who has come to 124 to take Denver to her new job, arrives at the house. Mistaking him for schoolteacher, Sethe runs at Mr. Bodwin with an ice pick. She is restrained, but in the confusion Beloved disappears, never to return.
Afterward, Paul D comes back to Sethe, who has retreated to Baby Suggs’s bed to die. Mourning Beloved, Sethe laments, “She was my best thing.” But Paul D replies, “You your best thing, Sethe.” The novel then ends with a warning that “[t]his is not a story to pass on.” The town, and even the residents of 124, have forgotten Beloved “[l]ike an unpleasant dream during a troubling sleep.”

8226,"Had an idea: Could the Fukishima waste water be separated and the water steam off through DEKA distillation, powered by another reactor if safe, instead of running into the Pacific ocean?

What if control rod material finely ground was fed into the core, even drilled with geological boring and fed a mile down? Also what about boronic water to cool, and pre-stage ion exchange with titanium oxide and salt before distillation to separate the waste instead of  dumping the approx. 300 metric tons  of contaminated sea water per day (used to cool the leaking reactor) back into the ocean?  Maybe CA should be piping Atlantic water for ocean/solar powered desalination or distillation and keep the Pacific off tap for now.

 check out what's happening to the Pacific.  These things should never have more than a 30 day supply of feul. This thing will maybe burn for 40 years. And think of every reactor currently stocked with that much fuel. If a reactor had a meltdown in the US every energy company would be scratching their heads as to how to unstock it with a 40 year supply of uranium when then need the meltdown to stop yesterday.

And a 40 year feul supply in a reactor built on a vault line at the shore of an ocean had to be the worst zoning ever

A 40 year feul supply in a reactor is a way to kill the future

Selling 40 years worth of feul at once to get paid today due what you won't be alive to seek about in 40 years, no problem, but then it should be stored separately and away from the reactor: off-site

Or maybe we'll all learn after the next 5 meltdowns...

Also toilets.. 


If only toilets didn't contaminate all the wastewater with viruses and bacteria that even build a protective shell around them to even resist chlorine and which point of use filters say they  remove from the incoming  potable water. In naure purification at its finest is evaporation, collection of vapor- condensation, rains, sand filtration, water again, maybe DeKa has an affordable steam distillation solution which would add steam disinfection for a new toilet to reduse waste to a disposable solid in a disposable compartment with a disposable liner that reduces human waste to a brick which goes to a landfill, like cat litter does, and whatever small amount of water and moisture used  steams out, disinfected as water vapor, then the wastewater is not contaminated by sewage etc, and the rivers won't smell like each town, and we'll reduce the amount of ammonia in the gulf, and wastewater minus all the toilet contamination from even entering will be more easily cleaned for use in irrigation, and perhaps the future bottled water companies will also use ocean desalination until it can be pipes directly as potable water through existing supply lines, and towns could easily hook up to a main line running from ocean desalination plants through all 50 states, Though CA and the rest of the US should be piping from the Atlantic now and using ocean kinetic and solar energy for desalination or distillation.  And some places are re-using waste water, going Toilet-to-Tap, their brains stopped there and went no further but to tell everyone drinking it that that's their best idea and it's great

Back to the toilet, the waste line at the toilet connection could be separated from the rest of the household plumbing and go down to a pit, or collector in the basement or outside the house, where household water is separated from waste with DeKa distillation and the solid waste removed in self sealing disposable containers.  It would eliminate a lot of treatment burden and treatment cost might go down on the city side,  while rise a little on the  users end, but with adjustments stay about the same per household.",HCQGydFK_hM

8396,"Yes quite horrifying. In which case mental states that can affect physical constituion, byway of so-called communicable diseases, or just by conveying ideas, should be understood more maybe. 

Aids for example, a sexually transmitted disease, first publicized by celebrities like Rock Hudson in the 80s, but probably in the populace by the swinging 60s and glitzy 70s. That unverified theories propose is a consequence of a virus that originally evolved inside primate populations (quite possibly bonobo chimpanzees, due to excessive sexual behavior also).

That then jumped species into humans, with the help of sexual deviants (who are prevalent in certain social bodies, like mercenary armies and foreign legions - more so in informal or clandestine militias 

Who are driven by psycho-social forces (in exile or under duress) to find economic and sociopolitical opportunities elsewhere (driven away by their own communities, or dominant groups of the area). To join these profit oriented organizations.

So that theories propose, that with the concentration of such personality types in such standing bodies, sent out by military or para-military campaigns into far flung areas (like Belgian Congo, or anywhere else in the World really). 

Whether as combatants or non-combatants (motif remains securing resources and opportunity for larger organizations, while addressing own personal and private needs. Which may have included one or more incidences of human to monkey sex - even as a bet among rowdy recruits, this is easily imaginable. 

All the while individuals and whole groups being used and using one another, always for purposes of personal advantage, when even group benefit is merely a vehicle to advance personal well being. As is encouraged by such thesis as the ""Wealth of Nations"".

So that it is often times, these in-between spaces (for example the gap between public life and private life) that is where manipulations and machinations can occur. In the same way that it is in these cracks and crevices that bacteria and viruses lodge themselves.

Reflected in human migratory corridors and transit networks, whether commercial or military industrial. Latter being larger and more accessible (higher volume), later being smaller scale. But both pertaining to how slowly or quickly people and elements (whether ideas of bacteria) mix and mingle.

Which is how the original problem (according to this theory) first arose to begin with. A sub-species of chimpanzee, famous for sexual behavior when encountering outside (potential rival) troupes, that other types of monkeys address byway of violence. 

As means to defuse tension and resolve implicit problems (such as resource entitlement). Resulting in some naturally occurring sexually-transmitted bug, pest or irritant in chimpanzees (not fatal) to balance out or prevent too much intermingling of genes (that has beneficial properties - genetic exchanges that spurs progress)

While similar patterns, found in human populations (far more complex, with far more variables) also taking place simultaneously. Intersecting, some say in a professional soldier of Asian descent (Gurkhas or Sikhs for example have long martial histories) in the continent of Africa (maybe victim of a prank or trick), meeting up with a monkey or chimpanzee in a jungle brothel somewhere!

Sounds like a sick joke!?! Or a spiteful and malicious rumor, meant to damage reputation, mental and emotional constitution etc.Cannot be the basis for life and social building? Or is it for those very reasons, that such a theory could prove to be true? Awash with all the famous qualities and preoccupations that humans are famous for?",AgZ5goJibn0

8616,"Eddie Murphy needs to shoot off his mouth. It's his best weapon, and the one that's unique to his arsenal. When a movie mostly requires him to shoot off a gun he becomes just another action star, and another talent wasted in lazily miscalculated material. Steven E. de Souza's script has Foley following a trail of murder and deception into an L. A. amusement park called WonderWorld. The director, John Landis, fails to exploit the possibilities. Murphy's trademark delivery is still impudently subversive, but it's too often wasted on unworthy opponents. The movie is like an advertisement for the 19 recently banned assault weapons.",DbP7Ptyr1sA

In the beginning of the movie when told Houston's character had an island we imagined a nice spread with palm trees and sandy beaches.  Nope it is a tiny rocky outcropping covered in bird guano.  It was so depressing, the characters were so disheartening everything was just a let down from beginning to end.

8959,"The problem with this movie is centered around ""Self Righteousness"". The truth is humanity is severely flawed. Left, right whatever!  Evil comes in many disguises and it has nothing to do with left or right. America was doned a democracy in 1776. Some call it a Republic. Some want a socialist government(the left). The ""truth"" is available through historic record which could be flawed and incorrect as well. However, a socialist government has never sustained and will always fail due to power hungry narcissistic dictators disguised as caring leaders of the people. Look at Hitler, Pol Pot  of Cambodia, Ho Chi Min of Vietnam, Stalin of the U.S.S.R. and lately Nicolás Maduro of Venezuala. 
This movie is speaking from a socialist perspective in the guise of ideology that is nice in thought "" we all want to live together in peace and harmony   but it is not attainable because of greed and power. You've heard the phrase, ""Power corrupts, absolute power corrupts absolutely!"" Hello!
Democratic societies historically have lasted about 200 years. America, arguably the most successful society in history is being pulled appart and on my view it started  during the Gulf War and was pumped up during 'Obama's regime.  Like it or not it's true. Power hungry people will always corrupt. Socialist societies have never survived. 
For Anlmerica to survive, stop open borders, insure people earn the right to be here, clean up the government and stop allowing the influence peddlers,  ""lobbyists"" hired by big corporations and break the direction of a Corprotocracy and recenter our nation on Judeo-Christian  biblical values that made America strong and attracted people from all over the world to be a part of the great experiment.

9116,The movie doesn't do justice to Tolstoy's great work. Leo Tolstoy didn't want Anna's character to look like that. More than a dozen main characters in the novel each portraying different principles in amazingly plotted circumstances of their own. Political religious social domestic agricultural philosophical scientific ideas discussed in an ingenious way in the novel. Behaviour and psychology body language which is Russian in soul in the novel to which the russian masses connect and all so wanting in the movie. Only names are same Russian in the movie; Russians talking in British accent. Ohh how can it all be mixed or rather messed up in a movie.  Very brave to have even thought about making movie on a novel consisting 8 volumes. And kitty was described as much innocently prettier in the novel than the kitty in movie. And it is not a romance novel not at all a mere  love story between Anna and Vronsky but between kitty and levin. Spirituality was prominent in their case as levin believed her to be pure as a dove.,Z-nyXX5zOLg

9122,For those who wonder why it got so many bad reviews: it's because people still don't understand that an adaptation doesn't have to be exactly like the book.

Ryan, check out The Big Town if you haven't seen it. Diane plays a club stripper and Matt Dillon fucked her a few times. She shows her titties in a sex scene with him at a motel. Tommy Lee Jones plays her husband and he owns a gambling club that Matt gambles at. I was surprised Matt fucked her but I guess he wasn't scared of Tommy LOL.",T7m4F5GlS5Q

9285,"I have just watched the 1968 original Thomas Crown Affair with the legendary STEVE McQUEEN and have been watching the 1999 remake with PIERCE BROSNAN for over 9 years,even know some scenes word for word.😉

I must admit, usually remakes are nothing and don’t come close to the originals. However this movie remake is 1000x better than the original.

From the beautiful music,the film’s rich texture,the clothing,the refined English language,the art(both in Thomas Crown’s clean Carrara Marbled house and the general feel of the MOMA)Rene and Pierce’s chemistry,the cars,clean all the way down to the detail of his JAEGER LECOULTRE REVERSO watch.

There’s isn’t enough adjectives in the world to describe the beauty of this movie...of the two,I will take the 1999 Pierce Brosnan’s version any day all day. I love how he celebrates at his home after snatching the St Giorgio Maggiore,he’s got such a clean and gentlemanly approach to it-no noisy laughter- from how he holds and pours that Chateau Margaux in his Bacarat glass to just how smiles and exclaims “Oh Yeah” at that painting is just way too clean.

SINNERMAN vs THE WINDS OF YOUR MIND...NINA’s music blends perfectly well with the scenes in which it’s played.

PIERCE BROSNAN WINS🤘🏿",B3AlaszZSJU

9344,I love sweet innocent Kimmy,cvnJeQi3eQ8
9345,Why have I not seen this movie yet,cvnJeQi3eQ8
9346,"spoiler alert;

I think Michael DID love Jules. You could see it in the way he looked at her when she used her gay friend George to pretend to be her fiancee. Michael looked at her with a certain look in his eyes when he was trying on his suit in the store and saw George there. He also looked like he was in love with her when he and Jules were on the boat and slow danced together....he even hinted at her to tell him she loves him when he said ""if you love someone, you just have come out and tell them right then and there"" but she ""let the moment fly by"" and didn't tell him. When Jules was at their wedding and said ""I don't have a gift for you, but here is a song on loan for when you find your own song"" and Michael got tears in his eyes and he either looked super grateful, happy, or sad....he looked sad AND happy at the same time....I think he loved Jules but didn't know it quite yet. He did marry the wrong woman, he even said so in the subway scene when he went to the subway station because that's where he proposed to Kimmy. But Kimmy wasn't there and Jules found him sitting on a bench and he said ""thanks for not letting me marry her"" aka he was RELIEVED!! He said ""I was crazy to think I could marry her without even knowing her well enough"". How does that not look like he loved Jules even a little bit??? He had to have loved her!!! :((( </3 I hope I never let an opportunity and moment ""fly me by"" like that in my life. :(",cvnJeQi3eQ8

If they did then maybe we'd be bombing Thailand or Cambodia in order to kill all the dirty caucasian men who moved there for just such a purpose.

9917,It had some good moments but the movie was overall dull. The ending would've redeemed the movie a bit if the protein drug ran out and they couldn't find a solution which would've caused the returned people to turn. Causing an outbreak and the zombie apocalypse.,B6h5vtY5qZU
9918,Good movie. at least it brings something new about zombies. Actually this is not a zombie movie. it´s about preventenig infected people from becoming a zombie. they have to take a antidote to stay ok. I liked this movie.,B6h5vtY5qZU

9921,"During the lecture, in The Returned, she says 100,000,000 death cannot be compared with any tragedy of modern history and I thought well she is right because the genocide of the First Nations which claims approximately  100,000,000 Indians over a duration of time claimed that many lives between the 1400s to 1800s. yes I know it is a movie, however, I do think its metaphoric.",B6h5vtY5qZU
9922,This had the same time and feel of the Walk in dead series as in it's not the zombie that's important it's the people dealing with the consequences of a zombie outbreak I liked it a bit slow at times but pretty good,B6h5vtY5qZU
9923,Is there the Returned 2,B6h5vtY5qZU

I mean the following they get is pretty huge compared to what rotten tomatoes thinks of it, I know it’s not exactly your typical vampire franchise but that’s why I’m into it because it so weird compared to others especially blood wars (the newest one) also side note if marvel get share rights with these movies I really hope they do team up blade and Selene especially since marvel had her first. Maybe the possible show they’re working on could be more marvel related so they could team her up because people thought blade was gonna be in the defenders and he never was and I know in marvel Selene is an xmen property meaning the mcu will have to do some tweaking if they want her but on the big screen she’s already a vampire not a mutant so they already kinda half way there",mQ8c4bGFmQc

Remember when Mr. Klein says that he didn't know how he got to his house?  He said that he had no memory and lost time.  I just realized that that is abduction.  I remember the videos of the witnesses who stated that there was a lot of UFO activity around there besides the Mothman and also Men in Black.  So in my estimation there was two things going on with Klein - first his abduction and second his connection with Mothman.  Aos the ""smiling man"" Ingred Cold was an alien.",bXcpwJbXT7o

10259,"A creative gem of story arc exposition, tense action/dramatic execution and good directorial interpretation: identifiable characterizations rusted on. Iconic cultural identity spaces, entities which present narrative through differed viewpoints of human agency that relate from wildly removed social backgrounds, and further distinctly separate global regions ..protagonists encounter forces of change, of cultural expression and human art form in a frontier western town backwater still righting old wrongs the traditional way. Not for the faint of heart there is blood and gore without ostentation or pretension: severed limbs in edged weapon fights, heavy caliber gunshot wounds in shootings. The movie production strikes a note of invention, or ring of truth - there is more than one orchestral pit in the story setting just watch and see. 

An under-rated movie, I am glad that I did get to see it at all even seven years late. You will find it a laud-worthy cinematic production that touches many original feature notes. Recommended viewing",Kq64CHaV8yA

10826,"I'm not gonna lie, this wasn't a great film, the trailer is fantastic though, which lead me to this conclusion:
1.Why making different Predators in this movie? If they would have stay with the original concept of the Predator, that would have worked just fine.
2. Why casting the guy from that's 70 show? He's not menacing at all and his acting sucks.
3. Why not writing something FOR the Predator instead of writing AGAINST it? The always tell us the story of how Predators lose against humans... BOORINGGG, make the Predators win for once to show us how menacing this creature is.
4. I would have like the story to tell us how the Predators were using this planet to train ""new bloods"" or hunters with no experience into hunting while having high ranking predators watching them and evaluating them, for example 5 high ranking Predators watching while 3 ""newbie"" Predators would hunt for recognition of their elders.

Maybe my ideas are terrible, but I bet is way better than the film they gave us and definitely better than the one from Shane Black which is pure garbage.",uzqYqoVoU74

I'm actually in love with my best friend, it all just dawned on me!"" This movie is painful to watch. Entertaining, but unrealistic, cheesy, and poor storyline.",XFQN3biQ4x8

I know production was difficult and they went through hell just to have it finished, but I feel like the resulting film was worth the efforts put into it. I'm saddened that it didn't come out the way Richard Stanley wanted it, but at the same time, I feel like they at least succeeded in having it stand on its own as a decent film. I hate to look like I'm singing it praises because of all the negativity it's acquired, but I have to admit that I have a serious soft spot for this movie. Not only was it the first time I ever heard of the Dr. Moreau story, but it was also the first time I ever saw David Thewlis act in anything, and he wound up becoming one of my favorite actors because of this role. I'm not saying this film is flawless, because it certainly has its fair share of flaws, but I do believe that the ""worst movie of all time"" label seems very, VERY forced here.",5QagEozqPZs

Sure you can't rank it as high as you would a classic Scorsese film like Goodfellas or Departed, or an above average movie like Donnie Brasco... But 5.9? The bad things I did notice in this movie are:

1) The movie is too short 
2) The ending wasn't summed up well 
3) Some moments felt lazy directing/writing
and my personal dislike is buying attention with strippers, very cheap move from any director, and most acclaimed ones still do it...

 1) Amazing performances

11292,"Your Jesus:  The only danger to humanity is man himself.
-Thursday, January 1st, 2015 @ 23:50

My dearly beloved daughter, the person who perseveres in prayer will become closer to Me.
With so much confusion in the world and amongst My Church on earth, the challenge for humanity is to be able to differentiate between right and wrong in the Eyes of God.

 But, for many Christians, they will be drawn away from Me by a new global form of evangelisation, which will focus exclusively on politics.
 Instead of being encouraged to remain loyal to Me and trusting in all that I Am, you will be pulled away from Me. You must never confuse My Word with the aspirations of a secular world. I have always made it clear to humanity, through My Father’s Book, of the dangers in doing so.

 A secular world serves only its own needs and men of power, ambition and selfish aspirations create the rules, which govern it.

So much misinformation has been spread in relation to the environment, when only God can dictate how the earth behaves. Man may harm and damage the earth but he can never destroy it, for all these things are in the Hands of God. A lack of trust in God means that man believes he has control over the universe.

 The foolish man thinks that his actions can change God’s Laws. The wise man knows that God is All Powerful and as long as He is revered, and His Laws adhered to, then man’s survival will be secured.
 The survival of the earth has nothing to do with mortal man. Only God has the power to control the air that you breathe; the water you drink and the ability to sustain life. The only danger to humanity is man himself.

Man will fool others in the interests of self-gain. He will lie if it is to his advantage and when it suits him. Trust is easily broken and now you are living in an era where you must know that the earth will remain as it was before and that any climate upheaval is by the Hand of God. Man’s intervention in such a divine creation will only be permitted if it is according to the Will of God.

My Church is My Body. All those who believe in Me are part of My Body. Those who are part of Me will follow My Teachings. Those who say they lead My followers must abide by the Word of God. Their role is to defend the Truth – not deviate from it.

If you are being pulled away from Me, and if My Word is being rejected by the world, then the duty of My sacred servants is to remind the world of what is right and what is wrong.
 When they remove themselves from matters, which concern the soul in exchange for matters, which amount to socialism, then know that this is a subtle and cunning deception. It also betrays all trust in Me.

11448,"The movie is apparently not available for free ehere, but you can find it on 123movies. It depicts the tip of the iceberg about the multinationals. The CIA covert operations to ""defend American interests"" are also well-konwn.",Ug9xufczPVE
11449,"I usually leave my brain and my politics at the door when it comes to watching movies. I just like to sit there and go; ""duh"". (Cue Homer Simpson drooling) 

But I have got such an instinctual loathing for this fascist who loves South American dictators and probably praises Fidel Castro and wears a ""Che"" t-shirt, I can never bring myself to watch any of his movies. 

On that topic I would highly recommend reading Humberto Fontova's articles at FrontPage Magazine and his book The Longest Romance: The Mainstream Media and Fidel Castro. I've started on his other book about that sadistic mass murderer ""Che"". 

Like Ilana Mercer's book about the genocide against white farmers and the brutal sadistic torture, rape and murder of their wives and daughters by blacks in South Africa, Into the Cannibal's Pot, The Longest Romance is heartbreaking reading.",Ug9xufczPVE

11550,"By far the best F&F film to date. However...i have to say, I am really impressed with the fact that a franchise can make 8+ movies, and *_still_* not only are thry on the big screen, but most of them are pretty damn good...some are okay and some are great. But the way they keep it all going with the plot twists, almost always different plotlines, bringing in new celebrity actors for almost every new film (Dwayne Johnson, Kurt Russell, Charlize Theron, female UFC fighters such as Ronda Rousey 👈LoL!!), all while keeping the same, original crew together after 17+ years. Now *_THAT_* is impressive. I don't care what anyone says.
People are so accustomed to and used to a movie franchise that has so many sequels (Friday The 13th, Halloween, Saw, Star Wars, The Alien Franchise, Final Destination, Jaws, i could go on all day) to automatically just being really really bad and not worth watching. And in their defense, most of them are pretty awful, and also are usually so bad they go straight to DvD (Think: Child's Play). 
So anyway, when someone goes into a movie with the frame of mind that it's going to be really bad, well, it usually is because they have that frame of mind for the entire film. Usually just waiting for it to take that hard left turn. Which it usually does. But when it turns out to be really good, they might think ""well, this wasnt bad at all"" but since they had that frame of mind for the entire film, it's almost impossible for them to forget all about the fact that you thought it would suck, and you can't really enjoy it as much as you could have, had you gone into the movie with an open mind, or thinking that it just might be good.
   So anyway, this post is long, sorry. To the point...
If you go back and re-watch ANY of these sequels that you thought were bad or ""would be"" bad, and you make yourself think they are going to be really great, then you will certainly enjoy it more, and also you will probably like it. 
  It's all a psychological thing and it really works. 
Just a brief example: way back when, I was just a kid and went to see 'Titanic' in the theater. I really disliked that type of movie as a kid, like most kids do. And initially didnt want to see it. But eventually i heard from several people, all over school, all over the tv, how amazing it was, and how everyone wants to see it again, etc. 
When i saw it, I liked it a lot. However, about 5 years ago I watched it again. Surprisingly i hadnt seen it since i was about 14 so i forgot most of it. Anyway, i didnt like it much at all and was curious as to why i liked such a film *_more_* at 14 than as an adult? It should've been the other way around. 
But again, it's all a psychological thing and bcuz i went into the theater with the mindset that it was a great movie. So i really actually enjoyed it at the time. 
   Anyway, thats something i learnes in college about how the mind works and can sometimes play tricks on you. Making you actually think and believe what you want to, and how easily it can happen. Very, very interesting topic.

And that is: I cannot stand the fact that Zhouyu and Zhuge Liang are somehow portrayed as ""great friends"" lmao they are suppose to hate each other (well Zhuge Liang doesn't hate Zhouyu but Zhouyu hates Zhuge Liang) it still ruins a lot of it for me for some reason. like... Zhouyu later literally dies because of his hatred of Zhuge Liang. Like I understand it will interfere with a lot of the plot and the overall heroic storyline but at least make it somewhat culturally accurate ( I use the word culturally because none of this is proven historical fact, for all I know the 草船借箭 (borrowing arrows from strawed boats) story is pretty much made up just to show Zhuge Liang's genius. But the story was originally a plan Zhouyu came up with to force Zhuge Liang to death (planning to cut off his head because the Zhuge Liang promise to make 100,000 arrows within 10 days is literaly impossible... anyways... it just doesn't work so well with me. sorry.",pd0bqLQrtdE

It's not just the racing, but the amount of depth and insight you can gain from this movie that can enrich your life in other areas.

I would wager that some of the critics of this movie are functionally illiterate, as described in ""The Closing of the American Mind"" by Alan Bloom.  They're the kind of people who use the acronym TLDR and complain of boredom.  Many more of the critics are ideological zealots who react like bacteria to antibiotics whenever the suffering of socialism is exposed - and can't handle an honest discourse about the topic.  Many of those ideological zealots contribute disinformation on this thread, with mocking and nonsensical satire.  It's a shame that they treat their politics like a Sunni Cleric treats Islam, and in their church of entertainment, they define the profane as any critical truth from history.",0vA-s_rthrI

Aynalı matruşka            ekim/1998. 

Işık benden, canı gönülden,
gölgeler günahlarınızdan, 
Haya(t/l) perdeye yansıyan.

İçi ayna olan bir insan içinde,teni
ayna olan bir insan doğsun.

Ayna olan bir insan
evren ona ayna olsun

yüreğinden 
ya da dilinden ne söylerse, 
ne dilerse olsun.
İnandığı yalan kendi dilinden, yerden kaldırdığı
avuttuğu kendi çocukluğu olsun,
Sarıldığı yada boğduğu yerde boynu olsun.
dilinde ve yüreğindeki kadar görsün ve anlasın,
                                ömrü herkese yüreğini yaşatsın.

İçi ayna olan bir insan içinde,
aynadan sırça o insan,
ağaç derse ağaç, düş derse düş
yaşa derse yaşasın, kıyamet derse kıyameti olsun
                             ne diyecekse yüreği onu yaşasın.

Ayna olan o insanın ömrü,
yüreğinin yelkovanı,takvimi Aşk'ı gösterdiğinde
bir düş görsün,karşısında bir insan dursun
sudan ince bir nehirden teni,aynalanan
iki insan kendisini, yüreğinin ta kendisini gördüm sansın
İki ayna kendisini anlatsın,  kendisini yaşasın.
'O'' insanın yüzüne, yüreğine yaklaştığında
kendi yüzüne ve yüreğine yaklaşsın.
                                       anladıkça anlasın,
                                       bildikçe bilsin,
                                       sevdikçe sevsin.

Yüreğinin taşıyabildiği kadar aşk, yaklaşsın yüreğine
öperken yüzünü, yüzünün içinde erisin
                          yaklaştıkça büyüsün yüzü ve yüreği
                          içinde sonsuza kadar düş'sün,
                          yaşamak aşk yada korku yüreğindeki sonsuzluk
                          çocukluğunun en eski ve ilk Düş yada Düş'üşü olsun.

Ulaştığında,
kendi ile düşünün bir ve aynı olduğu ayna'da
                                                        aşk'a düştüğünde kısaca.
dilinden aklına, sözcüklerine ardından eline değsin aşk.
Sonrakinde gözlerine, en derine yüreğine düşsün
Aşığım sana dediğinde 
           yaşadığı bütün insanlarda, ömründe
                                  sonsuz evrende çınlasın,Aşk.
İki insan durgun bir gölde yansıyan
süt mavi bir gökyüzü görsün
      düşbaz iki ayna yani bir insan
                 içi ayna olan sonsuz, bir gökyüzü
                                                 bir okyanusa sevdalansın.

                 Emeği kolay, ömrü su gibi duru olsun,
                                     aşık olsun da, AŞK'olsun.",RQUdbvUVfgE

12286,"La critica ne ha parlato male per la ragione che il film risulta un semplice film d'avventura e questo vuol dire che è stato giudicato con grande superficialità, perchè un film deve far riflettere e incuriosire. In questo film abbiamo diversi spunti che incuriosiscono lo spettatore e lo invitano a conoscere la storia di Luigi XIV, della Francia dell'epoca, della famosissima leggenda di Dartagnan e dei tre moschettieri, ecc. 
La critica non ha considerato tutto ciò che è alla base di questo (consentitemi) emozionante e superbo film.",CLwBmPZqiIY

12296,"@LoveLiveJump It was ""impossible"" because a woman who knew nothing about horse racing gambled on a horse that did the unthinkable. He won the Triple Crown after no horse had in 25 years & then broke each of the track records (Preakness time we'll never know since the clock broke) but set the track record for the Kentucky Derby & the world record for the Belmont & both still stand today. BTW, only 2 other horses won the TC since ..& both back in the 1970's. But Secretariat's times still stand!",UKmuvjL2cVw
12297,"The best video I've seen on youtube that captured what we emotionally experienced back when Secretariat won the Triple Crown in the 1973 Belmont is -""Secretariat A Moment of Eternity"". What he did that day was the only supernatural athletic performance ever recorded. Almost 40 years later...and no athlete has ever come close to that magical day we witnessed. Still brings tears to people's eyes.",UKmuvjL2cVw
12298,@catrinmorris Remember this is years and years ago that this horse lived. They probably didn't have the treatment back then.,UKmuvjL2cVw
12299,"@catrinmorris Sorry, but whenever I see a documentary on animal rescue on National Geographic or Discovery, the impression I get is, that they put down every animal that gives ""any trouble"". This happens to dogs which after not being fed regularly in the past don't ""pass the test"" of having a fake hand put into the bowl. Christ, I had like 5 healthy dogs and I would never even think of trying this.",UKmuvjL2cVw
12300,i <3 secretariat ,UKmuvjL2cVw
12301,"Secretariat was an amazing horse. But I can't help feeling bad for Sham. If he had been racing another year, he would for sure have won the Triple Crown. ;)",UKmuvjL2cVw
12302,"@LoveLiveJump Because the odds were so much against Penny.  She had to battle just about every force in her life to make this happen but she was determined and she wanted to leave a legacy that her father would be proud of.  It is extremely difficult to get a horse to the triple crown races, much less win all 3.   That's why there has only been a handful of them that have won it all.  Also you have to understand the times, Penny was a woman in a man's world.",UKmuvjL2cVw

Your point is valid and accurate.",Uw7PhPD31Ws

12647,This movie was such a disappointment. It managed to turn a great book into something dull and pedestrian.,8CD9ksgofU0
12648,"This is by far and away one of my favorite movies ever. With it's incredible cast...the Lady Chablis TOTALLY steals the show...this tale of Southern decadence is extraordinarily GOOD. An enormous contributing factor to the movie's excellence is the unquestionably brilliant acting skill of Kevin Spacey. Now, that having been said, I want to  take this opportunity to pour scorn on the shark tank feeding frenzy of EVERY SINGLE ONE of the so-called terribly traumatized men who came forward in a veritable flood of #MeToo mentality, claiming he'd done dreadful things to them DECADES after the event supposedly occurred.  For MY money, I  personally believe that ANYONE, male or female, who supposedly suffers a ""horrible traumatic experience"", then sits on that knowledge for more than a week,  either cares more about ""what people will think"" or  the damage coming forward might do to their career or reputation than they suffer emotionally from the experience they supposedly endured. If your goddam public image or your career means that much, that you'll keep such an awful experience secret, then you're kind of a gutless wonder to begin with...a perpetual victim.  These men who have come wailing and beating their breasts about how Mr. Spacey supposedly traumatized them are, each and every one, the living embodiment of Andy Warhol's prediction that everyone will be famous for 15 minutes. IF you've suffered an emotionally destructive experience, why in God's name would you hug that knowledge to yourself for 10, 20, 30 friggin YEARS, and THEN finally grow a set--I'm speaking of these so-called excuses for men--especially when you're the second, third, fourth etc. to  publicly do so? Did you HAVE to wait until someone needier, or a worse failure came crawling out of the woodwork? Looking for pity? Looking for some good old fashioned blackmail money? Looking for a boost   for your flagging or non-existent career? You phony whistle blowers are  just another verse of the song that has been sung since #MeToo gained momentum. I believe that, unless the person making the claim was PROVABLY in actual fear of his/her life, or was a pre-adolescent child, they should have to suck it up, accept that perhaps their lifestyle or social behavior put them at risk, but NOT be able to ruin a person's life DECADES after the so-called trauma occurred. The only crime which DOESN'T carry a statute of limitations is murder...and there's a good reason for that. Now, I'm not saying Mr. Spacey is entirely innocent of the accusations. I'm saying that NO ONE should be the target of knife, after knife, after knife in the guts because some pathetic bunch of attention-seekers are trying to boost a flagging career, or place the blame for being a lifelong failure on someone else.",8CD9ksgofU0

And, I now know why my interest rates at the bank are so incredibly high, funding investment bankers as they plod through the day with not much else to worry about than where to buy an original expensive silk shirt to wear at the dinner table. Or, which bottle of wine to fetch from the wine seller. A trifle boring for my tastes. Not the wine I'm sure, although it may have been over my budget as were the dinners all 5 courses of them. Only one question...who did the washing up? I now know the true purpose of a swimming pool, a litter bin. Nice stripped 1920s tennis jacket and the pink braces? Well, I didn't know they were back in fashion. But in Provence perhaps they're all the rage. I'm glad something is, cause the rest of this movie was far from that. But, there were some juicy scenes. Didn't see much of them though when this was on Film 4 TV cause the ads came on in the middle. What I liked the most about this movie was the music. Cool!",JmjXiAqyEfo

A series of terrorist sabotage acts were caused by Umkhonto we Sizwe (headed by Nelson Mandela) with the main aim of overthrowing the State (Government). The worst and most tragic (little known) sabotage act was the so-called Pretoria bomb, where 19 innocent civilians were killed during rush-hour in Pretoria.

So for entertainment, we had to rely on some movies my mother had brought and left there a few years back. 
So I was called into the room to watch a movie. 
I was more interested in playing my 3DS game. 
But I was listening to this movie whist playing. Eventually I shut it off, and I became intrigued in this movie. 
I ended up watching it twice that vacation, and I fell in love with it. 
I honestly hope to return to Acapulco in order to watch this movie again,",G-dafG40eGU

14260,"This is one of those (fx) movies in which the special effects truly compliment the bizarre story line of Cabin in the Woods.  Drew Goddard has done a masterful job of directing the tale.  It's as IF he took command of the Carpenters Square constellation ட and mapped out a patter of intrigue.  Of note is the featured performances of Richard Jenkins and Bradley Whitford in the high tech underground facility control room.  And today that same name match  of Richard and Bradley exists in the realm of 3-D printed linguistic monstrosities.  Under the name of Cognitive Vatican Sciences these two theologians of the Kretzschmar and Edmonds camp have dreamed up a social Media Cabin in the Woods ""cottage"" that as wrapped itself around the entire planet Earth.  Imagine now if you will - ghosts, mermaids, and werewolf armatures that actually translate in google to foundation statement expressions!  This is known as the art of Portmanteau Morphemes isolations; (the smallest grammatical unit in a language).  It's a journey into the Data Sprite and is being pioneered at this very moment at libraries such as Johnsburg, Antioch, McHenry and other Northern Illinois facilities.  Can the next generation of movie-goers actually survive immersing into a 3-D 360 degree haunt inside the box pattern you see here now 石?  This is the roadway diagram of Stockholm the capital of Sweden where the Norrmalmstorg robbery took place.  Yours in the box and you must battle bots such as the cranium skull circuit ஓ0B93 & ஒ0B92.

14586,"NORTH COUNTRY[15]
Directed by  Niki Caro

Calculated to appeal to the Oscars, North Country is one of those worthy, if overlong, cliche-ridden films about one woman’s courageous fight against misogyny amongst the mine-working community of Minnesota.

Worthy, because it’s about an important issue, the first class-action sexual harassment case inspired by the Jenson vs Evelenth Taconite Co that lasted from 1975 until it was settled out of court in 1998.

Cliche-ridden since after detailing the life and abuse of the central woman character, it resorts to all the sentimental platitudes that are common currency in Hollywood films that conclude with a court case.

Therefore to say it was inspired by events is a little like saying the 10 Commandments was the film of the Bible, almost true, but a technical e device to change the facts to suit the story.

Obviously, it might mean that the film reaches parts of the public other films don’t, but will, inevitably fall short when compared alongside such mining movies as Barbara Kopple’s Harlan County and John Sayles’ Matewan.

Whereas Harlan featured an heroic woman and, along with Matewan, showed trade union solidarity in a positive light, North Country resorts to casting the trades unions as corrupt as their capitalist counterparts.

It stars Academy award-winning Charlie Theron as Josey Aimes — a single mother who, unable to find suitable work to support her two children, decides, against the advice of family to apply for a job in an iron-ore mine.

According to local legend, mining was not simply men’s work, it was the only work in an area that had a high rate of unemployment, thus the attempts to keep the work as jobs for the boys.

Naturally, as with every capitalist company, if they can employ woman at lesser rates they will, especially if it splits the work-force, never mind that it might encourage a campaign of  harassment .

Apart from the usual verbal intimidation, it included men wanking over their clothes, graffiti-ing toilet walls with excreta, planting dildos in their lunch boxes, sexual harassment and rape.

Naturally, Aimes being of some character  complains. But, nobody wants to know, not her father who works at the plant, not her troublesome teenage son and, incredibly, none of the women, terrified of losing their jobs

Inexplicably, it also includes the only active female unionist — played by a feisty Frances McDormand — because, although she’s initially the reason for Aimes applying for the job, she suddenly feigns disinterest after falling seriously ill.

Thus, the struggle is on a two fronts — shaming the men into showing some sympathy while sparking the women to show some solidarity, not least since everybody seems to agree she’s got just cause.

There’s two inexplicable, fantasy scenes including the boss, one in which he welcomes Josey  in a diner and another, when he, not unsurprisingly, tells her that she’s free to resign without giving notice.

Enter Woody Harrelson, a former ice hockey star who has studied to be a lawyer but, until now, has had no cause to employ his new trade, so taking up the final third of the film in a soap-style court room drama.

You know the sort of thing, a sparky advocate provokes the court to see the error of their ways and we witness a mass show of solidarity as each and everybody involved stands up to declare, “I’m Spartacus.”

Never mind, it’s still one of the very few films about working class life that illustrates the time-tested maxim — workers united will never be defeated if you've got a good lawyer with a whole other story.

•	There is another one :  A policeman got promoted to a detective and get a case to observe mafia activities. He gets help of  his brother (whom he didn`t see for years and they have, some kind, cold relationship).Their father was also a policeman who disappeard, because he was involved in a drug business. At the end of the movie,those to brothers are sitting in a bar, waiting for a  person who should bring a bag full of money to pay drug stuff to mafia bosses. That contact person is actually their father, who has proved that he was not involved in any drug business and it was all framed/scam. Suddenly,mafia gang came to the same bar and then began shooting and struggle between them. Father has been shot and he dies in his sons arms",A2Qu80hRoh4

But more in the sense that you feel asif you've missed out on alot cause you don't know for sure what the fuck they're talking about, not so much in the second half though I'm just talking about the first 45 minutes, maybe I need to watch it a few more times cause I had the same issue with Heat when I was a kid but now heats probably in my top 3 films",A2Qu80hRoh4

The witty dialogue, interesting characters from the side of town I never visit, and good acting entertained me more than the plot, but the story wasn't bad. I could have done without Paolo loosing it and joining with the twins. And the amazing run of luck in the casino at the end was more than a stretch. Some good acting from Emir Kusturica, Gerard Darmon, Ralph Fiennes (cameo,) and Tcheky Karyo. Nutsa Kukhianidze was great, although I don't recall seeing her in other movies.

15127,"This movie was stupid and boring...I had high hopes for it because I'm a finance trader option guy.
I found all the characters to be bland and dry and drab and slate and underperforming. 
Ryan Gosling's character/face annoyed me, and those three supporting random dudes, and Steve Carrel annoying as well. 
If you like 'wall st' type movies....watch Trading Places, Wall Street, Boiler Room, Rogue Trader, Other People's Money,
All finance/wall st movies ....the characters come off as reptile annoying snakes.
All I saw in this movie were a bunch of male actors acting empty...not really convincing or selling or understanding the underlying story.
Gordon Gekko/Michael Douglas is the only guy who can truly sell in a finance/money/wall st movie....he looks and truly acts like he understands that world of finance.",vgqG3ITMv1Q

15198,They were trying to make this darker than the previous ones and with Moore still in the lead they just couldn't go to that place without it looking like a farce. The 80's was the low point for the franchise. Moore was getting older and audiences weren't given the time to properly get used to Dalton then the lawsuit. But if he'd been in driving seat from 81' to 89' they'd have grown that audience organically and those movies would have been classics. Dalton would also be a much bigger star.,e0iF8TCk4Fw

15297,"This movie is a dreadful adaptation of a classic like Pride and Prejudice. I have always loved that book and the BBC TV series which was phenomenal.
This movie has terrible actors, Knightley overacts and does not fit the roll of Elizabeth at all. 
The sisters (the actress that plays Jane I admit is quite good, I have seen some of her other work) are all terrible actresses that literally think that squealing and jumping about the whole time will be considered good acting.
The director has done extremely poorly in this film. For example, the scene where Darcy, Bingley and his sister walk through the gap between the people and go to the end as if they are walking to there throne is so unrealistic.
And when Jane becomes ill and Bingley goes and sees her in bed is also terrible. It is strange to think that the people working on the movie would have such poor knowledge of the 19th century, especially the early 19th century to think a gentleman would walk into a ladies room when she is bed and undressed in her nightgown.
That would never happen.

15549,"I'm sorry to say that, but Scarlett Johansson was an unfortunate choice for the role. She doesn't give us the slightest goosebumps as in the Disney animation. Generally speaking, movie casting shouldn't be based on big names just for the marketing, but should be based on actors really fitting a role. And Scarlett Johansson just doesn't fit. I mean the voice of Scarlett's Kaa or Emma Watson's autotuned singing is really flat to me",5mkm22yO-bs

15593,Yeah my mom was just like this boy's mom with depression and continued suicide attempts only worse because she molested me and beat me and raped me and put me thru human trafficking. I don't really like Hugh Grant's character but I guess he's better than nothing to help the boy. Sometimes you look for David Attenborough as a father figure and you end up with a drug addicted duck murderer who helps you just a tad. A tad is better than nothing I guess. But Sir David Attenborough would have never murdered that duck. May the duck rest in peace. :) I love ducks and ducklings. They're way cute. :),-apwoGTpi7E

That said this is an excelent movie.",fVIUEcizkPc

15611,This movie Rocks!!! It's on my top 5!!,fVIUEcizkPc
15612,Such an underrated movie.,fVIUEcizkPc
15613,"stylish trailer , even more stylish movie",fVIUEcizkPc
15614,"Nothing in human history can compare to this. Apollo 11 will stand for all time as man’s greatest achievement; not because of where we went; but how we did it.

I was a 4yo boy watching a B&W television. I watched a man climb down a ladder from his machine and on the surface of the moon.

The world was introduced to a new profession - the Astronaut.",ElzIPn1pXWE
15615,"I will not go and watch the new movie out called, ""First Man""  Unlike this movie....the new movie has no respect for our flag or America's sole role in reaching for the Moon.  ""First Man"" is a flop!!!",ElzIPn1pXWE

15617,The trailer doesn't do justice to the movie.,ElzIPn1pXWE
15618,Terrible movie.  An example that Hollywood got all wrong and I think it flopped anyway.  So many inaccuracies.  Why make a historical movie if it's going to be this full of mistakes?,ElzIPn1pXWE

15627,"The individual who said Sir Francis Bacon= William Shakespeare is quite deft indeed.  Mr. Bacon quite appositely fits the form behind these masterful works.  Even the most cursory collocation of the oeuvres of ""their"" works will make apparent the remarkable similitude.  The way in which one writes is ironically analogous to the way in which one can be identified by fingerprints.  The individual who wrote these plays was an adept in two senses of that word.  1) a practitioner of the first three of the seven liberal arts and sciences called The Trivium.  The politicization of the word 'liberal' is the penultimate smear before redacting it from the dictionary altogether.  Anyone currently living who calls themselves a 'liberal' or a 'liberal arts major' and has not studied the arts of General Grammar (as opposed to the special grammars whose rules are subsumed under General Grammar), Aristotelian or Formal Logic, and Classical Rhetoric cannot be liberal and most likely either joined a fanatical, demagogical, political cult of sophistry, or a pedagogical class with relatively little understanding of the depth and breadth of his or her field of study.  The intention attached to the extension 'liberalism' has been denigrated and depreciated so that it is today synonymous with socialism and communism.  This is a very Orwellian technique and this was not so 400 years ago.  I don't ask that anyone believe me.  Belief is irrelevant except where one possesses the will to transmute a condition into an idealized vision through what Napoleon Hill called ""applied faith."" Go to the OED and look for yourself and discover its etymological roots.  The second sense in which the writer of these works was a adept was another area which makes most people squeamish: the esoteric and occult arts.  This is because they have never been exposed to Latin and don't know what the word 'occult' really means or entails much in a likeness to the aforementioned issue of liberality.  For instance if one wants to profoundly understand Romeo and Juliet beyond its deeply beautiful exoteric albeit superficial veneer, one must possess intimate understanding and knowledge related to alchemy and astrology, two arts and sciences (art simply meaning something practiced and science simply meaning a body of knowledge) which flourished during the renaissance yet are routinely dismissed today as pseudoscientific.  This individual known as Shakespeare also possessed the wisdom of how to actuate these arts in a normative rather than a speculative way.  It wouldn't hurt to look into Neoplatonic thought, specifically Proclus' Elements of Theology to see how the Greeks defined beauty and had discovered its form in a three term analogy to gain insight into how these allegorical stories and plays can be both aesthetically entertaining and enormously enlightening.  Read Hamlet's Mill and consider that these stories have been told by countless cultures for centuries before this man recapitulated them.  Is there something in the microcosm which is a reflection of the macrocosmic universe?  Gaze longingly into the hermetic principle of Correspondence and you will see the true face of the creator of these works and the man who WILLingly became a conduit of its energy to explicate the ""mysteries"" of the Laws of Nature and Their Divine origin.",uBmnkk0QW3Q
15628,Anonymous i am on,uBmnkk0QW3Q
15629,"Although the overarching theory is completely out of touch with reality, the movie is really entertaining and tells a great story. If you can accept that the history is going to be stretched or even just made up in parts and can deal with some confusing time sequences, then it's an awesome film to watch.",uBmnkk0QW3Q

15666,"I've never seen this & it's due on in a few horrors & though it has the usual Horror Clichés, this one looks like its one worth watching...

With the dark October nights drawing in & Halloween just around the corner, it's perfect viewing for a fan of Horror Movies...

""Sush... Be Very Quiet & Whatever You Do, Don't Look Behind You ""

I have no idea if that is in the movie & I just typed it in & If your wondering Why I wrote that, it's simple as it's "" Implied ""

I've laid a seed of doubt & stepping back to watch what way it will grow because it's just primal human nature, especially if someone tells you Not To Do It & it works perfectly in the horror many other genre of films...

My Point!

Many of the great masters of filmaking in many film genres did this & used this to great effect that you would have sworn you thought you saw something but infact you didnt as it didn't happen & wasn't there in the first place & alot of modern horrors don't let the audience's imagination take them that little bit further because too many films show way too much...
And rather than implying or using audio & sound rather as visual stimulus to frighten today's modern audience's, it's all mostly about as much as possible & usually in CGi...

Take Alfred Hitchocks "" Psycho "" & the Shower Scene as even after many years later people would talk about that how you saw the victim stabbed to death & that added sound score as each thrust of the knife went in & added more to that scene...

All true except for one tiny thing, the knife never did enter & pierce her flesh, as it was shot & cut & scored in such a way to full you into thinking that's what you had seen... It was Implied...

Take Brian Di Palma's take on the old B&W update of "" Scraface "" for an 80's audience...

Again were in a toilet & the scene is set for Tony to be forced to watch his friend being tortured but when Tony won't tell the villain what he wants to know he goes for the Chainsaw & again warns Tony of what will happen if he doesn't comply...
Then there's a quick pan over to Tony's face being pushed by the point of the barrel of a gun, which forces his face side ways to make sure Tony watches his friend about to be tortured with a chainsaw, but Tony still doesn't comply because of his code & to do so would be to show weakness...

So the scene plays out & yet again for many many years people in general & fans of the film talk about many aspects of that cult hit classic & there's quite a few scenes to pick but the Toilet Scene is always talked about because of the torture with a chainsaw...

Briefly if I may this film was never a given to become a hit & it had alot of problems finding backers & then distribution because of the implications on the people portrayed in the movie & how that was the hot topic of human rights at the time...

Now for De Palma it was a risk he was willing to take & he made sure to point out in the end that this was not a correct portrayal of the people within that movie, but i digress...

Again you see the Chainsaw & some blood on the head but not the actual chainsaw cutting into that characters head because again it was implied & though they could've shot it that way, De Palma did what Hitchcock had done so many times before & used excellent cutting by the editing team he used & implied that this was what you saw & let your imagination fill in the gaps of that particular scene...

And there within is my basic point, Yes we have all these amazing graphics done via CGi but "" Just Because We Can, Doesn't Mean We Should "" isn't used enough with alot of today's horror films & alot of the time implying what is shown in a scene is better than full on showing it in all.its horrendous glory...

Time to watch "" Case 39 "" Fingers crossed it delivers...",Cd9t9yHK7Mw
15667,"The protagonist in this movie must be one of the most stupid ones I've seen. If I'm chased by a demon child that can create illusions of my greatest fears, I don't protect myself by locking my bedroom door! Not to mention that thats exactly what the previous people did! She does everything wrong. Her too-ordinary mind can't handle the occult, so instead she just runs around screaming and being scared. What about reading the internet on how to deal with this... or at least something better than putting locks on your bedroom door or hiding under the bed? No, instead I'll just run around telling everyone I know that my adopted child with a super cute face is a demon. I'm sorry... but seriously...

The, back then, young Jodelle Ferland has a cute face, but had seriously bad acting skills. She pulls off some of the scary faces, but whenever she talks.... she's 'acting'. I've seen child actors do way better. 

It was ok for a one time watch. Couldn't really get into it, but it had some great actors. The plot had an interesting premise, even if it seems that you only get chased by a demon when you have zero problem solving skills. Maybe it picks its targets that way.",Cd9t9yHK7Mw

15791,"Arnold Alois Schwarzenegger (born July 30, 1947) is an Austrian-American actor, filmmaker, businessman, investor, author, philanthropist, activist, politician, and former professional bodybuilder and powerlifter.

He served two terms as the 38th Governor of California from 2003 to 2011.

Schwarzenegger began weight training at the age of 15.

He won the Mr. Universe title at age 20 and went on to win the Mr. Olympia contest seven times, remaining a prominent presence in bodybuilding and writing many books and articles on the sport.

The Arnold Sports Festival, considered one of the best professional bodybuilding competitions in recent years, is named after him.

He is widely considered to be one of the greatest bodybuilders of all time, as well as that sport's most charismatic ambassador.

Schwarzenegger gained worldwide fame as a Hollywood action-film icon.

His breakthrough film was the sword-and-sorcery epic Conan the Barbarian in 1982, a box-office hit that resulted in a sequel.

In 1984, he appeared in the title role of James Cameron's critically and commercially successful science-fiction thriller film The Terminator.

He subsequently reprised the Terminator character in the franchise's later installments: Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991), Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (2003), and Terminator Genisys (2015).

He has appeared in a number of other successful films, such as Commando (1985), The Running Man (1987), Predator (1987), Twins (1988), Total Recall (1990), Kindergarten Cop (1990), and True Lies (1994).

As a Republican, Schwarzenegger was first elected on October 7, 2003, in a special recall election to replace then-Governor Gray Davis.

He was sworn in on November 17, to serve the remainder of Davis' term.

He was then re-elected in the 2006 California gubernatorial election, to serve a full term as governor.

In 2011, he completed his second term as governor and returned to acting. 

Schwarzenegger was nicknamed ""the Austrian Oak"" in his bodybuilding days, ""Arnie"" during his acting career, and ""The Governator"" (a portmanteau of ""Governor"" and ""Terminator"") during his political career.

Schwarzenegger married Maria Shriver, a niece of the 35th U.S. President John F. Kennedy and daughter of the 1972 vice presidential candidate Sargent Shriver, in 1986.

They separated in 2011 after he admitted to having fathered a child with another woman in 1997.",PeH_fzD5W8w

This movie is my absolute favorite version of Cinderella. There was no magic or spells or anything like that, just a pure beautiful love story. The acting was superb on all parts.  Drew Barrymore has always been an amazing actress. Angelica Houston played an amazing villain and Dougray Scott is played a great handsome and dreamy prince charming.

15821,"Howdy, ya'll.  I ain't gonna do anything fancy like an introduction or nothin' like that, so I'm just gonna jump right into it.  If you be divin' into this flick, thinkin' you're gonna get yourself a fast-paced, explosive action film ...  Well, you best be takin' your horse and trottin' on outta here.  'Cause you see, this here motion picture ... it be aimin' for somethin' different, and it gets it.  It has you totally believe these folks are real ... that everything that's happening is real.  The writers of the script believe in what they're writin'.  And because the writers believe it, the director believes it, the actors believe it, the producer believes it, and the film crew believes it.  And because they all believe it, you believe it, too.  It draws you in ... it captivates you.  It's mesmorizing like you couldn't possibly believe.  Yeah, there's times where it drags around like it's got lead in its boots, but that's the only thing it has going against it.  If you're aching for an old-fashioned cowboy flick with modern, first-rate production values, this ain't gonna disappoint.  It's even got those old-timey elements that are insinuated rather than said right-out;  when our two heroes are readying themselves for a final shoot-out, they go and do something that will bring out the best in themselves ... by going and gettin' the best chocolate and cigars that money can buy ... and it even brings out the generous side in 'em.  We also got ourselves some powerhouse performances from the actors involved ... and I ain't just talking about the big names in Hollywood.  Naw, it ain't perfect, but by the time I finished watchin', I didn't care.  I wanted to see it again ... and more than once.  And I have.  I don't regret a single minute I spent watchin' this flick ... not the first time or the last.  And that's a fact.",4werfN6fQ44

15953,"Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered weak and weary,
Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore,
While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,
As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.
`'Tis some visitor,' I muttered, `tapping at my chamber door -
Only this, and nothing more.'

Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December,
And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.
Eagerly I wished the morrow; - vainly I had sought to borrow
From my books surcease of sorrow - sorrow for the lost Lenore -
For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore -
Nameless here for evermore.

And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain
Thrilled me - filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;
So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating
`'Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door -
Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door; -
This it is, and nothing more,'

Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,
`Sir,' said I, `or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;
But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,
And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,
That I scarce was sure I heard you' - here I opened wide the door; -
Darkness there, and nothing more.

Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,
Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;
But the silence was unbroken, and the darkness gave no token,
And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, `Lenore!'
This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, `Lenore!'
Merely this and nothing more.

Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,
Soon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.
`Surely,' said I, `surely that is something at my window lattice;
Let me see then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore -
Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore; -
'Tis the wind and nothing more!'

Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,
In there stepped a stately raven of the saintly days of yore.
Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;
But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door -
Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door -
Perched, and sat, and nothing more.

Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,
By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,
`Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,' I said, `art sure no craven.
Ghastly grim and ancient raven wandering from the nightly shore -
Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore!'
Quoth the raven, `Nevermore.'

Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,
Though its answer little meaning - little relevancy bore;
For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being
Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door -
Bird or beast above the sculptured bust above his chamber door,
With such name as `Nevermore.'

But the raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only,
That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.
Nothing further then he uttered - not a feather then he fluttered -
Till I scarcely more than muttered `Other friends have flown before -
On the morrow he will leave me, as my hopes have flown before.'
Then the bird said, `Nevermore.'

Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,
`Doubtless,' said I, `what it utters is its only stock and store,
Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful disaster
Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore -
Till the dirges of his hope that melancholy burden bore
Of ""Never-nevermore.""'

But the raven still beguiling all my sad soul into smiling,
Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird and bust and door;
Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking
Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore -
What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore
Meant in croaking `Nevermore.'

This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing
To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom's core;
This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining
On the cushion's velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o'er,
But whose velvet violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o'er,
She shall press, ah, nevermore!

Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer
Swung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.
`Wretch,' I cried, `thy God hath lent thee - by these angels he has sent thee
Respite - respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore!
Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe, and forget this lost Lenore!'
Quoth the raven, `Nevermore.'

`Prophet!' said I, `thing of evil! - prophet still, if bird or devil! -
Whether tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,
Desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted -
On this home by horror haunted - tell me truly, I implore -
Is there - is there balm in Gilead? - tell me - tell me, I implore!'
Quoth the raven, `Nevermore.'

`Prophet!' said I, `thing of evil! - prophet still, if bird or devil!
By that Heaven that bends above us - by that God we both adore -
Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,
It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore -
Clasp a rare and radiant maiden, whom the angels name Lenore?'
Quoth the raven, `Nevermore.'

`Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!' I shrieked upstarting -
`Get thee back into the tempest and the Night's Plutonian shore!
Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!
Leave my loneliness unbroken! - im black above my door!
Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!'
Quoth the raven, `Nevermore.'

And the raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting
On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;
And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming,
And the lamp-light o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;
And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor
Shall be lifted - nevermore!",7lzFIcfdH7g

The opening spoken parts introduce: The bodyguard, a female train guard, female suicide bomber, female armed police officer, female sniper cop, female bomb disposal officer, female ma'am boss cop, female home secretary and her female pa. What went wrong? In the interests of 'diversity' I want to know why the bodyguard was a man.  Couldn't they conceive of a female bodyguard having a lesbian affair with the home secretary? Typical BBC. They could have at least made the bodyguard trans-sexual. And preferably an ethnic minority. And disabled too. How else are we to believe that the BBC is fulfilling its mandate to reflect the society we live in? I mean, apart from the bodyguard character, I would very roughly estimate the odds on all the rest being female as about 1/10x10×10×100×100×5×5x2 = only ONE IN HALF A BILLION.

16166,"A) Cara Delle Vigne was brought on set not for any particolar scting skill: she less than the least of actresses, as it is.
She's got THE RIGHT BLOODLINE, though: DELLE VIGNE Is one amongst hundreds of characters from DANTE's ""The Divine Comedy"", which stands for ""The Joke of ""God"""" in italian, meaning her lineage goes back 700 years. She's considered as ""representing"" Dante himself, in a way, and everything he stood for during his life: the origin of the italian freemasonry embodied in an allegory (THE BELOVED WOMAN Is the Brotherhood, hence the ""Love"" for ""her"").
(B) As for the ""plot"", the ending scenes make absolutely NO SENSE, but for the fact that  (Cara) DELLE VIGNE makes a hence nonsensical trip to RAVENNA -the beach sequence- where Dante is buried...
You connect the dots and you'll have the whole picture",ag_I15RBl-0

Why tell the audience “im gonna make you my special project”, then literally off screen say nevermind to the whole issue.

A Nightmare on elm street 5 the dream child is also a good movie. Freddy's dead the final nightmare is also a good movie. Wes Craven's New nightmare is also a good movie. Freddy vs Jason is also a good movie. i did not like the 2010 remake of A Nightmare on elm street but it is still better then this. If you want see a good movie see Friday the 13th. Friday the 13th part II is also a good movie. Friday the 13th part III is also a good movie. Friday the 13th the final chapter is also a good movie. Friday the 13th part V a new beginning is also a good movie. Jason lives Friday the 13th part VI is also a good movie. Friday the 13th part VII the new blood is also a good movie. Friday the 13th part VIII Jason takes Manhattan is also a good movie. Jason goes to hell the final Friday is also a good movie. Jason X is also a good movie. I do not like the 2009 remake of Friday the 13th. But is still better then is. If you want to see a good movie see Halloween. Halloween II is also a good movie.,6dxEtoTXZE0

قصته عن : ثلاث نساء في زمان ومكان مختلفين ، لكل واحدة منها قصة مختلفة ، لكن يجمع بينهن : الخوف ، والإحباط ، والإكتاب ، والروتين اليومي ، والتضحية ، والإنتحار .
فالقصص :-
١- الأولى : سنة ١٩٧٥م في لوس أنجلوس : أمرأة تشعر بعدم السعادة لكثرة الحمل والإنجاب ، رغم أن صديقتها تحسدها لأنها لا تستطيع الإنجاب ، فتقرر هجر زوجها وولدها وإبنتها - وهذا شبه الإنتحار - .
٢- الثانية : سنة ١٩٢٣م في لندن : أمرأة تشعر بعدم السعادة بسبب مرضها ووحدتها وعزلتها وعدم الإنجاب ، رغم إن أختها تحسدها على ما تقوم بتأليفه من روايات عظيمة ، فتقرر الإنتحار حتى يتسنى لزوجها الراحة والسعادة مع غيرها ، بسبب معاناته مع مرضها .
٣- الثالثة : سنة ٢٠٠٢م في نيويورك : أمرأة تشعر بعدم السعادة من حبيبها الذي فقد أمه وهو صغير ، وأنعزل عن العالم ، وعاش لوحده مع رواياته ، وكلما حاولت تأخذ بيده يرجع ويسقط ، مع أن رواياته عظيمة ، والكل يحسدها على هذا الإرتباط والصداقة ، بينما هي في الداخل تتألم من هذا الروتين اليومي ، خلال كل السنين التي مضت ، وهي لم تعش حياتها كباقي النساء ، فيقرر حبيبها الإنتحار ، كي تمضي هي قدماً في حياتها مع غيره .

مضمون الفيلم : 
أن السعادة أمرٌ يصعب إيجاده في الحياة في كل لحظة ، بل لا بد من شوائب مع الصفاء ، وشوك مع الورد ، ومغيب مع شروق الشمس .

وأنا أتابع هذا الفيلم أتأمل جمال نعمة الإسلام الذي : بين لنا أن الحياة فيها العناء والشقاء مع السعادة والراحة ، وأن النعيم والسعادة الحقيقية هي في الجنة ، وتحريم وتجريم من ينتحر ويقتل نفسه ، لولا هذا التحريم لكانت جثث الناس في كل مكان لأتفه سبب وهو : الضيق والإكتاب ، الذي يزول من خلال الإيمان الروحي ، والعلاج الطبي .",TZJCVilXbjQ

16628,Honestly i hated this movie. So many historical inaccuracies. This film is so dated with scenes that are just laughable. The acting was phenomenal but the script and direction was horrible.,DyGBwrtIamw
16629,This movie turned 20 years old a few days ago it's still a classic I love❤,I-WZYQ6nABA
16630,The movie is a comedy and the seed of chucky was too but that just made the company loose more money thats why curse of chucky the good film didnt go to theaters because the last film was so bad bride is okay but seed is awfull pluss Andrew Toone is right its better than twilight.,I-WZYQ6nABA
16631,This is an awful movie. Child's play 3 is one of the scariest movies ever. And this not scary. It is just awful. If you want to see a good horror movie see A Nightmare on elm street. A Nightmare elm street 2 Freddy's revenge is also a good horror movie. A Nightmare on elm street 3 the dream worries is also a good horror movie. A Nightmare on elm street 4 the dream master is also a good horror movie. The original Friday the 13th is also a good horror movie. Friday the 13th part II also a good horror movie. Friday the 13th part III is also a good horror movie. Friday the 13th the final chapter is also a good horror movie. Halloween is also a good horror movie. Halloween II is also a good horror movie. Halloween III season of the witch is not a very good movie. But it is this still better then this. If you want to see a really good horror movie see Halloween 4 the return of Micheal Myers.,I-WZYQ6nABA

16647,"In the Summer of 1969, I was home in Wahiawa and saw the ""Japanese planes"" circle for the attack on Wheeler Field (then an AFB). I even took pictures of the ""reel Zeros and Vals"" as they flew over for the movie cameras. (Note: I I saw the aerial activity over Wahiawa some years later for the vastly inferior ""Pearl Harbor."") Locally, the big news was the death of a movie stunt pilot who crashed into a sugar cane field. The south end of Cane street had a large, concrete wall apartment building, which stood in for Honolulu. It is now August 2017, Wheeler is now an Army Airfield, hosting helicopters, a ""Tora! Tora!

16836,"The premise has a flaw, many would press the button out of curious disbelief. i.e I don't believe this nutjob story, $2 milion and someone will die. Preposterous.  Here let me prove it, *pushes button*.
Some might push the button also in defiance saying that as it isn't wired to anything nobody can know.  Therefore again its preposterous.
These same people might NOT press the button if they believed it was true.

The logic here is that if the expect the button units to be fake not pressing the button raises questions for later, wheras pressing the button gets a result.  As the expected result is nothing, because the button unit doesnt have any wires or gadgets that report usage and because the related cash reward and death are a ridiculous motion it makes sense to press the button claim not to have pressed it and for nothing to come of it.
The experiment holders are getting a lot of false data.

The only way to get closure after examining the box without pressing it is to lie to the collector.  On retrieval of the button unit say that you pressed it at a particular time, nobody died and nobody is paying me because its all bullshit.  The button unit collector will be able to verify the lie giving some indication that there is more going on.  And possibly opening up avenues for questioning.

Of course some people will reject the box, and some will want the cash reward, but those are not the only moral outcomes.  As the button units are a moral test, it needs to adequately reflect the thinking, especially allowing for how critically important the experiment is as revealed by the film (not spoilering that).",nSOjMkoBYYA

17158,"فيلم دراما وكوارث جميل
قصته عن : ظاهرة عمى تجتاح البرازيل ، وتنتقل من شخص لأخر ، فتضطر الحكومة لوضعهم في محجر صحي ، لكن بينهم أمرأة ترى ما يجري حولها ، فتبقى مع زوجها الأعمى في المحجر ، لكن بعد فترة تتخلى السلطات عن المحجر ، فتعم الفوضى فيه ، وكلٌ يتصرف فيه حسب رغبته وشهوته ، ثم يبدأ القتال على الطعام ، وعلى كل ما هو موجود من أموال ونساء ، ثم بفضل هذه المرأة تنتهي الأزمة ، وينطلق الناس إلى الحرية ، ولكنها حريةٌ مقيدة بالسمع واللمس ، فتعم الفوضى أرجاء المدينة ، ثم تتكفل المرأة بخمسة أشخاص من جنسيات مختلفة مع زوجها ، ويذهبون إلى منزلهم حيث الهدوء والراحة ، ثم تحصل المعجزة ويبدأ أحدهم بالإبصار والرؤية ، ويدخل هذا الأمر التفائل والأمل للأخرين .

الفيلم طرح عدة أمور من أهمها :

١- ظاهرة الوباء .
٢- العدوى وكيف تنتقل من المريض للسليم .
٣- أهمية الحجر الصحي عند ظهور العدوى .
٤- التكاتف والتوحد عند المأساة .
٥- المصائب تجمع القلوب وتوحد البشر ضد الظلم والجوع والحرمان .
٦- العمى الحقيقي في القلوب وليس في البصر .
٧- ظلم الإنسان لأخيه الإنسان .
٨- حب المال والنساء طبيعة بشرية .
٩- عند الحوادث والفتن لا بد من ربان يحرك السفينة ويقود الركاب لبر الأمان .
١٠- أهمية الحاكم والسلطان في حياة البشر ، فبدونه تعم الفوضى والقتل والسلب والنهب ، حتى ولو كان ظالماً وطاغية .
١١- الصبر وعدم فقدان الأمل .
١٢- تحمل أخطاء الأخرين ، لأجل الصالح العام .
١٣- عدم مجابهة الظلم بالظلم .
١٤- القتل الحل الأمثل : لسفاك الدماء .
١٥- تحمل المسؤولية عن الأخرين أمرٌ عظيم ، لكنه شقاء وعناء .
١٦- حالة البشر وقت الضياع والتوهان في دروبٍ مظلمة .
١٧- الطعام والشراب والجنس ، أشياء لا يستغني عنها الإنسان .
١٨- التفائل بغدٍ مشرقٍ وسعيد .
١٩- دور المرأة لا يقل أهميةً عن دور الرجل في الحياة ، لكن الرجل هو القوام .
٢٠- الفرح والسعادة لرؤية الأخرين في راحة وسلام .
٢١- التواضع والسماحة مع الأخرين ، فالكبر والطغيان أهلك من كان هو أشد بأساً وقوة .
٢٣- الأقدار أسرار ، لا يعرف حكمتها إلا رب الأرباب .
٢٤- القدر ليس منه مفر .

والطريف في هذا الفيلم - مقطعين - : 
١- "" وضع العمامة على عين المسيح المصلوب "" . 
وذلك إشارةً من النصارى بأن إلآههم لا ينفع ولا يضر فهو أعمى مثلهم .
٢- عندما أصيبت رئيسة البلاد بالعمى مثل شعبها ، ولَم تصنع شيئاً لنفسها فضلاً لقومها .
وهذا فيه إشارة - ولو بسيطة - : أنه لا يفلح قومٌ ولو أمرهم إمرأة .


وقد أبدعت الممثلة العالمية : جوليان مور في هذا الفيلم كعادتها في أفلامها الأخرى .
وَمِمَّا يعجبك  في تمثيلها أنها تختار الأدوار الجميلة والبارزة في الأفلام ، فهي لا تقف عند أفلام : الخيال أو الغموض أو الجريمة أو الرومانسية أو الدراما وغيرها ، بل تتنقل من دورٍ إلى دورٍ أجمل منه .",Px5LBgsKuiI

He was on his high school basketball and football teams but was really too small to be played regularly by them, but then he realized he could compete in long distance running, and to his credit he milked that talent for all it was worth.
Prefontaine finished fourth in the 5000 meters race at the 1972 Olympics.

It seems like he was the only one who actually understood how to deliver McCarthy's dialogue, because everyone else said his dialogue so unnaturally, like they were just in the wrong era to be talking in such a poetic way. They just didn't get it. And that reflected horribly in the movie itself. It would have worked so much better as a novel, and probably if it was set 30 years ago (although then a lot about the cartel wouldn't make sense for back then). It's such a shame it failed because it had so much potential. I still thoroughly enjoyed it though, because the writer was the star here, not so much the acting.",6ML50I0mVHY

17324,"The black magic has remained in tact through the art of family. They were placed in such tight nit communities that the magic was never lost when colonizers stole them from Africa, then bringing them to North America as slaves. Though their tribes, customs and traditions were lost, they still carried the pebble stone of life, family along with them in the shadow communities they were caged into. Restricted from human rights, the black magic was forced to do none other than learn. Watch. Watch again. Watch until you understood how to do it perfectly. And while the black magic watched, the colonizers continued each generation, growing further and further into darkness. 
So the black magic did just that. They did everything better in the world they were slaved into. By oppressing African Americans, but ignorantly allowing the black magic to survive they created the best of the best. Forced to learn how to live like their oppressors. And from then on came are what to be the Black Panthers. Marching in Numbers, and in Riots, they marked a wedge in the systamatic system the colonizers created. They begun building a ladder to be climbed on the oppression the colonizers placed on magic people. Black people are what have proven the colonizers way of life is wrong.
They are the army the original people of turtle Island need to regain peace and harmony.",SQvPRb4HADE

At the same time they could've just left it on a high note like they did for Scream 2. Yeah movies like these develop a cult of fans, why push them away with shitty movies? Look at everybodies career's that took part in these movies, & none of them ever recovered. David Arquette's only serious movie roles. Courtney Cox, that last time i seen her, was in the Longest Yard, what happened to Neve Campbell? Matt Willard, & Jaime Kennedy are the only 2 that can actually headline a movie today.

They modernized it and made some changes for example when it comes to music choices and dancing. But why not? I like that the movies are not 100 % alike. Some like the original more, others prefer the remake. Nothing wrong with that:) I don't really have a preferance.

17572,"Inspiration for FD6:

Names for characters:
Luke (main character, boy)
Ashley (main character, girl)
Jason (main character, first person to die, boy)
Dane (main character, second to die, boy)
Tritiny (main character, third to die, girl)
Tim (main character,  fourth to die, boy)
Fred (main character, meant to die before Tim, boy)

Premonition place:
This place will be a cruise ship. The ship is named “SS coaster”. The disaster is caused by a tsunami.
Luke has a vision of the ship capsizing, and, as usual, wakes up and tells everybody to get off. Nobody believes in him, even the other main characters. But the others (Ashley, Jason, Dane, tritiny, Tim and Fred) decide to get off.
They go sit on a bench near the port, just when the ship starts sailing away. A couple of minutes later, the ship capsizes.

Deaths:
Jason: hanged by rope in basement, rope tightens around his neck to tight, and makes his head blow off.
Dane: electrocuted by wire.
Tritiny: head squished by bowling ball.
Fred survives by avoiding getting hit in the head by a bowling ball, kinda the opposite to trinity’s death.
Tim’s death: chain fallen in the mouth, come out the neck.
Fred’s death: run over by car. (Off screen)

17874,"This movie has clear anti-white messaging.  It's saying that Europeans should welcome their own demographic replacement by brown people because brown people are actually better at being Europeans than the native population. The movie pushes the notion that all brown people have been victimized in some way (they were refugees in this movie) and therefore have every right to live in prosperous white countries because they need our help. To deny them this charity would be a validation of our original sin, which all whites are born with, and should be looking to shed. It encourages white people to let go of their culture in lieu of a more vibrant diverse culture. Anyone holding on to European culture and norms is tarred as being stuffy and irrelevant. And finally we have the most important messaging that white European women should breed with brown people and have brown babies. Anyone who objects to this notion is old fashioned and bigoted. It's easy to see why this kind of targeting works on older white Christians who have been gaslit with the white guilt narrative the hardest for decades. But we as the younger generation should recognize this propaganda for what it is and speak out against it.",MWo67uhzoQg

18154,My favorite part of this movie is when the German soldiers were loaded up on the boxcar and after the door was closed started singing one of the songs that they had to learn from the Scottish soldiers. I can't really explain it I don't know if it was the way the German officer who shot the door stopped in his tracks when he heard them start singing or if it was just the fact that these men had just spent the last few days basically turning enemies into Brothers it is just such an overwhelming moment that I just can't help but tear up every single time.,KRrr-CDXijs
18155,"If the movie only showed us the truce, it would be decent. But the fact that it shows what happened next, how the soldiers couldn't just return to their trenches and continue to kill one another... it makes the film a great piece of art.",KRrr-CDXijs

I've read the take of Kim Philby and while there are parallels this like most of Le Carre based works comes off as paltry compared to what could have been masterful. The worst of which is the Tailor of Panama. Very believable acting but the music (mostly jazzy) was wrongly placed and there was a certain overdone aspect which could have been eliminated by mirroring the style of Murder on The Orient Express with David Suchet instead which ends very profoundly. I guess this movie lacks profundity. As much as people say it invites rethinking, it does not. It could have been so much better with the same cast. It tested no faith and thereby consulted no deeper meaning to raise resonance. In other words it comes off as too true a mirror of reality instead of heightened for meaning. A spy turned double-agent because he was bored. Very true and probable but fiction should raise the stakes.",VW-F1H-Nonk

I see the earth as nothing more than how the cave people lived. Spending time as a family loving eachother in a place where it was just nature that highlighted the day. I say screw all forms of competition and have my life be about REALITY. Not one person will be taking any trophies to their grave and the last time I checked, every generation ends up at the cemetery. I'd rather just take life's hint of all that has been in the world and live in happiness.

I would question, ""is it just me?"" if it weren't so extremely obvious. And even then, I'm perplexed by this to the point of deeming it too much to believe...       This CGI is bad... *ON PURPOSE!!!* Never have I ever witnessed any situation where it was clear that it was the filmmaker's idea to have INTENTIONALLY bad CGI in a live action film (well, maybe one, actually, but this one hits HARD!)! What in the world am I looking at?!! There's absolutely no question that these filmmakers designed these animals TO LOOK FAKE. They WANTED that!!! WANTED IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It was their idea to make these animals look cartoony!!!
I almost can't even fathom this! What madness possessed these filmmakers? Who would do anything like this in making a movie?!!! THIS is what you call suspension of disbelief? Why would you SET OUT with the INTENT of making these animals look bad?!! I thought the idea of blending digital effects into live-action was to make it look CONVINCING!!! How did we go from Jurassic Park to the point where filmmakers are actually TRYING to make bad-looking CGI creatures?!!!!!!!
As someone who has the mind of a filmmaker and the ultimate ambition to be one, I find this so offensive that I feel like I could honestly pitch a fit! My filmmaker's mind deems this simply (If I may at this point be intentionally overdramatic for one second), ""HEATHEN!!!""",mVmIG6ambLk

Remember seeing it on HBO  back in the day,and no doubt was attracted to it cuz of the beauty and fame of Carrie Fisher, which at time couldn’t see her in any other role than Leia + had Chevy Chase who was funniest comic actor at that time. For the most part it does fall flat but it’s slapstick attention to details of 1930s Hollywood  period is well done considering it was made in early 80s.
Perhaps if it were viewed today it might be better for its uniqueness .

Because of that I've been making a point of seeing their other movies. I was hesitant about seeing this one because of the bad reviews but ended up laughing and enjoying myself and wondering what the hell those critics were thinking. That was up until the end scene, which was horrible. It's as if Harry Hurwitz wrote a decent screen play, then lost a card game to a rival screen writer who then purposely wrote one the most confusing, corny, cliche endings ever.",UJnzY4nn57o

It is dynamic and sets the mood for all the drama and action. The actors for every part are perfect matches for their role, I especially love the old monk who gives refuge to the fleeing main characters.

The moment when Joanne screams at Tommy and Tommy lashes out with an insult as though he's unperturbed, yet we see how hurt he really is -- Downey Jr. is superb at that moment. The moment in Joanne's basement, after an unpleasant conversation with Claudia, when Joanne resumes her stair master workout, stops, almost despairs, then musters her determination and continues marching in mid air going nowhere. The montage while Nat King Cole sings ""The Very Thought of You"" and we see each set of characters at their best because they're in the place, with the people that really make them feel safe. Ann Bancroft screeching with laughter, through which we barely make out the words, ""Your father can't keep his hands off his organ."" Henry, the father, talking to Tommy's new husband Jack on the phone, congratulating him."" It's a Wonderful Life"" for a modern audience.

19296,"Well, what can I say? The suspense works but right now I'm kinda thinking that it should also be a comedy since paparazzi is very common to a celebrity unless I am wrong. The kid should have also set some traps on the paparazzi team like a Home Alone kind of thing.",zb7yyUnZnbU

19336,Michael Moore is getting rich off of all you gullible liberals based on the premise of elites ruling the world. Would you like to know the economic system that made him rich? Capitalism.,JeROnVUADj0
19337,It's funny how this movie had a budget of 20 million....yet only made 17.4 million. Michael Moore doesn't like capitalism because he doesn't understand how to thrive in it.  Free - markets rule!,JeROnVUADj0

19344,Trust me nothing will change. The people don't have any power and they can't do anything besides making themselves look like a clown. You think those financial institutions really care what you think about them? Obviously not. Why would they care about poor people like us when they can rob us out of the final dollar we have in our pocket,JeROnVUADj0

19351,I saw the movie today and I call it absolutely amazing and pretty epic. I don't care if Max Von Sydow is an Atheist or agnostic but I still think Jim Caviezel plays Jesus perfectly. George made a great movie and critics tempt it and they should be ashamed. I like this movie but I'll never watch it again not because it has nothing to do with my love for Christ and God but I just don't have Common with Max's performance.,on3M7YWlewo

Owen accepts her even though he knows she's a cold-blooded murderer. He will become one because he has chosen Abby as a paramour. This mini- evil vampire survives by creepily seducing little boys into being her daytime helper.  She never ages, but Owen will, and he will end up just like the old dude familiar Abby bites and throws out of a hospital window, dead meat.

I also dimly remember this as a kid, not the plot but the title sequence and Vaughan being in it.
No surprise the Royal Navy and Marines got credit for cooperation, the warship is a Type 61 Aircraft Direction Frigate, built in the late 50's as basically floating radar stations to detect hostile aircraft, though too slow to keep up with aircraft carrier groups.
By 1978 when this series was made, the last were about to be retired so that likely eased use of it by the TV people.

I remember most that title sequence, basically 1970's military stock footage, the control panel and trigger for a Polaris missile, RN Sea Slug Anti Air missiles being loaded, a US Polaris A1 leaves the sub, morphing into a RN Polaris A3, then that red prototype Tomahawk Cruise Missile, (20 years before the RN got some of their own for their subs).

Good story but already seen in nowadays hundreds if not thousands movies today .

A nice cast but it saves nothing good to what the movie offers a wow trailer but movie is bland .

Many eastereggs from both lead actors Pierce Brosnan & Milla Jovovich in their movies they starred . 

For Pierce Brosnan = James Bond, The Tailor of Panama , Thomas Crown Affair ,....
For Milla Jovovich = Fifth Element , Resident Evil , ....

It has even some old series/shows The Professionnals , Mission Impossible.....

There's even some video games scenes , Call of Duty , Battlefield and another movie Black Hawk Dawn .

1.  It really drags on in places.
2.  I did not like Casey Affleck's performance.  He just seems to mumble his way through the whole film.  However, I did like Amy Ryan's performance even though I hated her character.
3.  The part about the deranged couple in Everett didn't make sense.  They were already on the police's radar, yet the bust would not have occurred if Patrick and his coke dealer friend did not do their own investigation.  Couldn't the police have done this on their own?
4.  Like most commenters, I really hated the ending.  This woman was not just a sub-par mother.  She nearly killed her child by letting her roast in the car for two hours.  Patrick clearly made the wrong decision.",itPTyd3DkEw

Sadly, when her parents died I was sad. The boy (Rudy) I was so sad when he died and sadly his last word was: ""i love you"" unclearly.

Is writing love stories bad now? That you have to write the Nutcracker out of his own story.

I saw THIS trailer a long time ago on an actual movie I was watching and I had to plug my ears and shut my eyes because I was so innocent and everything scared me back then.

20416,"this film that was taken from the true story, ""Emily Rose Exorcism"". for me as a muslim, I was quite confused in this movie because ""the main character"" was possessed by the devil, she looked afraid to see the picture of the Christian god (Prophet Jesus) and refused to drink the Holy Water that the priest gave, and could be hurt by Christian readings. This is because in Islam, there are also recitations that can hurt the jinn. these recitations are practiced by Muslims to drive Satan out of the human body in the real world. I wonder, ""is not Satan just afraid of the God of the Muslims?"" or Satan is afraid of all things which considered as God by humans (though it is not a god according to Islam)? or the devil just pretends to be in pain to make people (who the wrong religion) believe that their religion is true?",Bi-PLwxwvy8

( This Bad Santa movie; pinball-scene is the only movie that I've seen so far that accurately depicts what Brooke actually looked like the first time that we had sex. There seems to have been some kind of major effort cover-up by gestapo to claim that she was way younger when we first met for sex. I have no idea or anyway of knowing if they forged her birth certificate, pictures, videos etc. in their deception fraud in this situation. For some reason gestapo has made movies that depicts Brooke as having been a 7-11 year old girl when we first met????? What is going on here?????? )

Because the camera was focused a lot more on the fear of each actor rather than the alien itself. This gave us the feeling of being there in the woods with them. You need to redo a film with the same kind of atmosphere, at the moment all the subsequent predator films completely failed to immerse the viewer into the film. Sad but true.

20918,"This movie is just another a piece of vulgar liberationist propaganda. The rigid, repressive Christian morality it depicts has been destroyed and discredited decades ago and doesn't hurt people anymore. What's the point of criticizing it? Why didn't the director make a movie to criticize the laziness, shamelessness, narcissism and self-indulgence of today's people? These traits have created problems like debt, obesity, and a high divorce rate that deprives children of the love and stability they need to grow up into functioning adults. These are the problems that are going to destroy our society if we don't tackle them now.

But the makers of this movie clearly don't have the balls to criticize their contemporaries. Instead they criticize people who are dead and aren't causing us any problems. The makers of this movie are cowardly herd animals who propagate things that most people believe, so they and their audiences can feel like brave non-conformist heroes.",5KJKvvvxY74

21047,Told the whole damn story in the trailer,ki0g87P1rOA
21048,"Basically this movie was to advertise Tyler Perry/ Keisha Knight's 's murder and cloning behind the scenes. Basically whenever a celebrity is murdered cloned, they will show up in their video/movie with some sort of code word for death like ""vacated"" ""expelled"", ""suspended"", like in the opening scenes of this movie showing Madea's drivers license and other documents. Then they will be dressed in blue and red- or you will see a blue and red theme throughout the movie in their scenes. In the first scenes it talks about Madea giving the policeman ""the blues"" then ofcourse Madea shows up in a blue dress. Red is for blood sacrifice and blue is for clone as per the Matrix blue pill, red pill analogy (the movie itself shows the cloning factories which we are meant to believe are fiction but are real). And ofcourse code blue is hospital code for cardiac arrest and revival i.e cloning. In one scene where Madea is at  Kmart, you will see the red and blue sign and next to it the words ""die hard"". Which is more secret code.  In Keisha's scenes (rudy from Cosby Show...lol) you will see her standing next to a hotel when she's prostituting. This is a reference to the phrase ""Heartbreak Hotel"". You will hear this phrase referenced in many songs as they pertain to death and cloning and stands for  cardiac arrest. It's the same thing with the Michael Jackson Billie Jean video when he's climbing the stairs up the building of a ""hotel"" (yes, cloning goes back decades and has been kept secret). You will also see blue and red on the window when she escapes (another metaphor for ""vacating"" i.e death) and when she's in the telephone box. Speaking of which telephones always refer to being an industry call girl behind the scenes. This is corroborated by the whole theme of the movie itself which is ghost written/produced by the illaminati read (illuminati) to advertise what goes on in real life behind the scenes. You will find a strong pimp theme throughout like where Joe, Madea’s brother is holding a cup with the word “pimp” written on it. You will also see her in a silk bathrobe. In music videos and films this is always code for industry prostitute to the ""elite"" behind the scenes. Also look out for the skulls on the walls in the background in one scene when she's waiting for customers which stands for Luciferian elite and Dr. Phil doing the illuminati hand gesture (three fingers and a circle which stands for the all seeing eye and the three for 33 degree freemasons) while he interviews Madea. There is other symbols but this is just a brief introduction. This will help explain why Tyler Perry's movies during/after this period (2009) especially contain themes which promote the usual ""elite/il-lame-inati agenda and stereotypes about black lives i.e ghetto, alcoholism, mentally unstable, cheating in work/schools that they like to promote in the media. That said, it would have been half decent if it had been written and produced entirely by Tyler Perry. It has a strong story line and a good moral about helping people/women in need instead of letting them fall victim to the streets and prison system. My only gripe is that it became a bit “fairy-tale-ish” at the end. That said- great acting from the supporting cast and standout performances especially from Keisha Knight Pallum.",ki0g87P1rOA

21394,"One thing ABOVE ALL THAT I HATE is doing remakes! But that goes for legendary films, that are perfectly made (like Scarface, The Hitcher, Solaris, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre from 1973, and many, many others...). But when it comes to Evil Dead, although it's been known as one of the most popular & best known horrors of the 80's, it was very poorly made (despite its success), due to its low budget, extremely poor special effects and many other things. Therefore, this remake, from 2013, is probably one of the VERY FEW REMAKES EVER MADE (in any genre, or films in general) for which one (true film aficionado and connoisseur) could say that is actually not just good that they made a remake, but they surpassed the (bad) original in so many ways, and ended up with a truly awesome horror flick, a true masterpiece, which combined supernatural with slasher horror in a perfect way. Especially nowadays, when we're getting sick of all those supernatural ghost and demon horrors, that began with Insidious saga, then The Conjuring Universe (including Annabelle) and now, The Nun - although most of them greatly made by the new masters of the genre, Leigh Whannell & James Wan - yet, this was such a great refreshment!!! Definitely one of the best horrors of this decade, od 2010's!

21668,"What nearly all christians do not know:
""According to the Old Testament the Messias would liberate the Jews from the Romans. Therefore the Messias had to be a warrior and a direct descendant from king David, because King David never lost a battle and therefore the Messias would win every battle too. Jesus - if ever he existed - ended at the cross, he did not liberate the Jews and therefore according to the Bible he could not be the Messias. You see - the Jews have no reason to recognise this failure.",pVfmdLO2Ui8
21669,"Btw it's just a movie I am a Christian I like the look of this film no need to debait on what's true or false and what jesus looks like will blow all expectations out of the water he isn't white or black he made us in his image so we all look like our father some way or another His head and his hairs were white like wool, as white as snow; and his eyes were as a flame of fire;And his feet like unto fine brass, as if they burned in a furnace; and his voice as the sound of many waters.And he had in his right hand seven stars: and out of his mouth went a sharp twoedged sword: and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength.",pVfmdLO2Ui8

And did so many wonders in such a small time, it would be impossible to record everything he did, but atleast we have the living word, in t he bible.

21901,"Damn this movie has more Fucking twists than Hideo Kojima video game.
MAJOR SPOILER:

I like how this trailer creates this illusion of making you think that the BIG PLOT TWIST that you see in the trailer is the end of the movie. Kind a like Creepshow, but it doesn't end there.
The Protagonist finds away to get out of the grid after he is deceased  because his original self from the Real World  took control of him and that's why he murdered the A.I Fuller because he went Edward Snowden on the simulated VR in 1930's Vintage Los Angeles, with his whistle blowing tactics. So he got killed by the Original Protagonist
Now when he tried to kill Fuller's daughter the original model that came from the Real World into the VR, the Allstate Guy saved her in good hands by shooting the Original Protagonist who is dead, but then after the consciousness of the  A.I Protagonist is switched into the Original one from the Real World and then they live Happily Ever After with Fuller's Daughter, finally meeting her Father who was his Boss back in the VR World.
Here is the Question, if you die in the VR World your consciousness gets switched with the A.I version  and Fuller got killed. So how do we know that this is the Real Fuller ? Now that's one Plothole that I noticed and the scene ends with it digitally turning off like a TV. Now I don't know if it was just made as an ending style to the movie, or this was left intentionally as a Piece to an unsolved Puzzle that they are still in a VR World even though they are legitimately convinced that they are in the Real World. 
But in fact there could be a High probability that they are still in a VR Simulation


But nevertheless, Brilliant Movie",XF6etkcJp_c

When you don't know whether to blame the writing or the acting in a film you know you're watching crap, I kind of feel sorry for Clancy Brown as apart from the music and the scenery the only thing you can rescue about this film.  As for Christopher Lambert, you could have put Paul Lambert in it and wouldn't have improved it, but at least you would have got a Scottish accent (though you might not have understood it right enough),  This film easily qualifies in the top 5 worst films I have ever watched and to give it context, I had to sit through the spice girl movie on account of my 5 year old son!!",omOZyLmNMJs

And there is much more.  This might be the best US movie in my library with a primordial Christian message, intentional or otherwise, and I am definitely not a ""church-type""nor do I associate with any such..

And there are Patrick Melrose (I firmly suggest you to watch that series), Doctor Strange, The Child in Time. But then I also watch the interviews, I see that he supports a lot of right causes (feminism, LGBT community), I see how much lovely he is with his beautiful wife and friends.

For a long time I had planned to see this movie, (mostly because Eddie Redmayne is my favorite actor since 2012 when I saw him in Les Miserables) but it never happened ,you know what I mean? This year I finally decided to watch it,  and I loved it! It was like I got to know Stephen, sure I had heard of him before, but I suddenly learned so much more. I was completely blown away by this story, and the music was something extremely powerful that I always cried to, and I couldn’t stop listen to it.
About 2 days later the news were everywhere, and it for real broke my heart. Stephen is no longer with us, but I think he’s sitting up there somewhere, still exploring the universe💫✨ He was a brilliant man, he knew what he was doing and had a head that is too unbelievable to understand. I feel kind of cursed because of this, how can he pass away 2 days later, just when I got to know him??... I will miss you deeply, Stephen, and I send all love to you in Heaven💕🌷🌹 Rest in peace, Professor, the angels must watch over you👼🏻",Salz7uGp72c

I do have to say that as the Laurie-Michael showdown went on it started to get boring because every single time Michael was walking toward her slowly, she screams a lot, them narrowly escapes with a few seconds to spare. Still a great movie. Laurie definitely isnt the sharpest tool in the shed because when she is at the entrance to the hospital, she could have got into the car next to her (The wheels were fine unlike all other cars and the keys were never taken out of the car) Again, great movie, *SPOILER* I am sad Loomis died, I liked him :( 
Also, sorry for this whole rant, I needed to let my feelings out. Don't hate me for anything I said, it's just my opinion and I am sorry if I offended anyone.

22613,"In case any are confused on what a real witch is, I'll sum it up for You.

Life is not Harry Potter or to do with the movie Illusions of the Craft with flying and idealistic things.

A Real Witch is one who knows that the Tools are but Symbols of what is Within the Self.

A Real Witch knows their own Limitations with Nature's Help.

A Real Witch has the Power with the Essence of Nature to Direct all things to go in a Productive way from within Themselves out.

A Real Witch doesn't Waste time making silly Cursed Objects in Hopes that they will Work.

A Real Witch is the Cursed Object against any Opponent's.

A Real Witch Doesn't bring all of Hades into anothers world because they just don't like them.

A Real Witch is both Loving and Cruel to those who really Deserve it.

Hence why Nature is kind with the warm sunlight but brutal with the cold night.

Don't use the Tools, Be the tools in all that you Do in dealing with Situations and People on what you want to Achieve.

Bright Blessings,

Beth Marie",oa-fbQ7SbyM

22753,"this movie should have been a hit. it was probably too deep for the average movie goer. She was a victim of circumstances, in his opinion, and she was only trying to survive n the best way she knew how. he understood that and protected her. but the crimes she did bothered the movie goers, more than it did the guy that was following her. the movie goer did not empathize with her as he did.  The writer of the story did not write it to have the reader or movie goer connect with her, and that is why it was not a success at the box office. in real life the average citizen believes there is no excuse to murder people as she did. That is also why they killed her off at the end, making a total tragedy out of the story. which ends up making people depressed and let down. Don't we get enough of that in real life?",5E--MQm-AdE

They've tried to make a good remake of the French original from '83, and create a suspenseful neo-noir thriller, but failed big time! There isn't practically a moment when one feels the rush, or the suspense, or the erotic fuel in the background, which every thriller should have, let alone a noir film! Only numerous scenes that supposed to be interesting and intriguing, but they are running like watching a saturday afternoon family movie!

Both of those universe had a very similar movie but both were terrible. It would be hard to find a universe where this movie isn't terrible. The only remotely good version takes place in Earth beta max 17. In that universe people age 1 year, every 100 years so chris lambert still looked as good as he did in the original highlander movie.",5Og5iESh2jg
22821,"The trailer is absolutely a deceitful tactic of the worst kind, and by the fact that there are three or four different edits of this film, the mess didn't end with the marketing.  This franchise practically begged for fan edits to come into existence because there are multiple cuts of every film, and Endgame is probably the largest editing disaster of them all.  Though, The Quickening has some severe continuity problems in its editing alone, but at least that got adjusted in the Renegade & Special Edition cuts.",5Og5iESh2jg

None of the cool stuff from the trailer and it's all depressing and emo with new plot twist that don't even match up with the series!? Bad writing, bad acting and bad editing with unfinished effects! Overall let down that will have to be re-edited into a salvageable fan-film at some point! 😞😤",5Og5iESh2jg

Characters, especially the lead ones, are there in the sequences sometimes to suggest the real nature of concepts and ideas that can formulate their shapes according to the twisted and morbid situations.
The intertwined nature of visions, dream imagery with the latent fears of the real world create a sense of dread, dejection and longing that can create ripples in the minds of the characters to further agitate their state of beings.

I would like to see a second movie that focuses on more advanced concepts.

In this movie the computer software shows the characters struggling to resist the urge to perform the computerized actions.

The electricity courses their brains stimulatsting their motor cortex and decision making parts of the brain.

However what if this technology was advanced to effectively control

Decisions making
Memory
Emotional
And
Motor cortex of the brain

This would create for a person unaware and happy that their decisions and movements were controlled by an outside force.

This could be run by an automatic computer system.

https://www.vitamodularis.org/articles/could_a_machine_feel_human-like_emotions.shtml

This would allow world leaders and military figures and populations to be controlled their whole life's as unaware yet happy automated and programmable people. 

Creating for a new system of human population management. 

Even if they figured it out their memory could be erased or altered via the technology.

Her presence, voice, acting, everything makes her one of the most charismatic actresses I have seen in last 15 years.  It is also pity that since 2009 she mostly played minor roles, but I think she should be back to bigger projects soon. At least crime  series No Offence where she now plays one of three main roles should I think establish her back as one of the shiniest British female stars.

23444,"Not one of Eastwood’s better efforts. It’s so full of bad writing and sloppy set production. A spoof on the mythology of the gunfighter West, the movie becomes a spoof itself. Take the cinematography. It makes no attempt to be accurate. The sets are a modern perception of what the Great Plains look like. Watch for the seasons and settings gaffs. Is it Spring, Summer or Winter?
Had to get the obligatory train in there but couldn’t get their wild west town where the tracks were? Couldn’t even bother to fake that? Watch for this one. Rides through a wheat field, twice, even after acknowledging you get shot for riding in someone’s field. Had to get that cowboy golden sunset in there. In a movie where they are supposedly questioning all that, they roll out the old tropes. Oh and the buddy formula. Ridiculous at best. And just more examples of zero desire to be the least bit accurate. It’s all a bit sad that this movie is held up as some sort of correction to the gunfighter mythology and makes the writer of it as a clown character. Ironic that Clint and team were just as big in the clown dept. Maybe they knew this and were spoofing anyone who took their schtick seriously?",ftTX4FoBWlE

23476,"Really great movie! In fact, here's an analysis I made about this movie which is based ENTIRELY off my theory about how everything could've happened in the story of the movie: 

1. The only conceivable way this can be a sequel to the movie “The Poseidon Adventure” (1972) is the fact that BOTH films were directed by Irwin Allen.
2. Doug Roberts (played by Paul Newman), the building’s architect, was away on vacation during the building’s construction. If he was instead watching over the whole construction, he could’ve had a better chance of catching electrical engineer Roger Simmons (played by Richard Chamberlain) in the act of “cutting corners”, and as such could’ve stopped him.
3. While Simmons cut corners to cut the costs of the building materials needed to construct the Glass Tower, if he were smarter, he or the Tower’s owner, James Duncan (played by William Holden) would’ve called up Roberts on the phone during his absence and run all suggestions for changes in any of the specifications of the tower by him, and ONLY installed them if he APPROVED those changes!!
4. Though the Glass Tower in the movie is always referred to as just ""the Glass Tower"", since James Duncan was the owner of the building, a really good name for the building would've been ""The Duncan Tower"". 
5. Before Callahan and his assistant test the power generators in the utility room, another worker comes up to him and asks him if they have the G12 generators in stock, to which he replies yes. Due to the faulty wiring (and presumably the G4 generators being overloaded), the power surge which soon sparks the fire in the Glass Tower is triggered. Had they delayed the generator testing to swap out the G4s for the G12s, the risk of the electrical flare up occurring would’ve been reduced greatly to very unlikely or even impossible.
6. In the aftermath of the auxiliary generator flaring up in the utility room of the Glass Tower, Doug and Will Giddings (played by Norman Burton) notice that conduit safety coverings have NOT been installed despite the original specifications calling for that! However, restrictors and surge protectors (which could’ve prevented the flare-up) probably should’ve also been put in the tower, but those TOO were left out! As a result, the electrical hardware that was powering the Glass Tower was at full power, and as such put too much load on the wires!!! This would explain why Doug wanted wiring that was “way, way above standard”. However, Roger Simmons explained that each and every wire he put in that building has been tested, inspected, approved, and strictly up to code! Simmons may have been right, but the wiring he put in would’ve been ordinary wires, which would NEVER have been able to handle high voltages that the super advanced machinery generated. This led to ALL the machinery forcing heavy unrestricted electrical current through very thin wires, causing them to heat up. In fact, the wires and equipment got so hot that the plastic wire covers melted, and eventually, the slightest spark formed a connection between two bare wires, hence the explosions and fires occurring throughout the building. This also would’ve happened if two bare wires somehow moved close enough to make contact with each other!!! This is like using a power outlet to power a puny lightbulb only to make it overheat and blow up!
7. When Doug Roberts, Will Giddings, and Public Relations chief Dan Bigelow are in a meeting with James Duncan about the “scorched wire from a burned-out circuit breaker”, Duncan calls in Roger Simmons only for him to be labeled as “out”, therefore unable to report to his office. There’s no doubt that at that point, Simmons was staying home at a time of day when he SHOULD’VE been at the Glass Tower working!! He would’ve been fired for skipping work. But then again, Simmons probably had some other issues, maybe an argument with his wife Patty Duncan Simmons about something, so he was in no mood to be at work; he probably needed a day off. If this were the case, he never said anything about this to anyone.
8. There are some points in the movie when characters mention the fact that the sprinklers are not working. However, in one scene early in the film, Will Giddings mentions that they “haven’t finished installing the safety equipment”, which could explain why the sprinklers didn’t work. However, even if some (if not all) of the sprinklers were hooked up and functional, the auxiliary generator short circuiting in the main utility room would’ve caused a power surge throughout each and every wire throughout the entire building, thereby frying the fire prevention devices, and rendering the sprinklers inoperable.
9. Though there’s no specified date the movie is set on, it’s a good bet that the events depicted took place on a Friday in autumn of 1974 (around the timeframe the movie was released to theaters), as some other tenants wish each other a “nice weekend” before leaving.  
10. It’s a good bet that Simmons had also snuck in the containers of flammable chemicals and paint cans (and probably some magnesium as well) in the storage room on the 81st floor where the FIRE STARTED!!! It’s also a possibility that Simmons had somehow managed to bribe the fire inspection team to approve the wiring despite their lousy quality. Doug Roberts never knew anything about this, hence him telling Fire Chief O’Harran (Steve McQueen) that there were no flammable materials in the storage room where the first fire started. It’s also safe to say that Simmons is even responsible for leaving cement at the south stairway entrance door, preventing it from opening, hence the need to dynamite the door.",nch1URmJvMA

23515,"This really isn't ""based on a true story"" but more like ""inspired by an historical event"" 
The only thing true about this film is that it was Jamaica's first bobsled team, and that they knew very little to nothing about it. 
Other than that, all made up. 
There never was no Irv Blitzer (John Candy), there were more than 4 of them, they didn't almost make it to the Olympics in South Korea, and obviously Junior is a fictional character who never tripped those guys on the track and ruined their chance to go to Seoul for the Olympics. And much, much more that's simply just not true.
In fact, one of the actual members of that team stated about the film, when asked how much of it was true, something along the lines of ""the only.parts that are true are that we went to the Olympics in Calgary, and that we almost didn't get to go due to finances"".  
  Although, there was never anyone who sold their car to produce the funds for them to go. From what I remember it was a sponsor who had done that.",wLlmymHRNZg

23771,"فيلم دراما وسيرة ذاتية بديع ورائع وجميل 
قصته عن : كاتب صحفي يتعرض لجلطة قلبية ودماغية ، تجعله مشلولاً لا يستطيع الحراك ، ولا يتحرك منه سوى عينه اليسرى ، والتي هي اللسان بالنسبة له ليتكلم مع الأخرين ، فلم يبق له سوى السمع والبصر ، لكنه يملك الخيال والذكرايات الجميلة في حياته ، ومع عجزه أستطاع أن يحقق المستحيل ، وذلك بتأليف كتاب يحكي فيه عن حياته وذكرياته ، وكل ذلك من خلال رمش العين .

تطرق الفيلم لعدة قضايا من أهمها :- 
١- القضاء والقدر .
٢- المستحيل يمكن تحقيقه .
٣- الضعف والعجز يفجران الطاقة والنشاط في الإنسان .
٤- العجز الحقيقي ليس في الجسد وإنما في الروح ، فإذا تغلبت عليه الروح ، كان الجسد سليماً .
٥- عدم الملل من العلاج الجسدي والنفسي .
٦- الصبر والتحمل ، والتفأل والأمل .
٧- الحبس ليس في الجسد ، وإنما في اليأس والقنوط .
٨- الخيال نعمة يستطيع معها الإنسان العاجز ، التحليق في الفضاء ، وعبور المحيطات ، وقطع المسافات ، ورؤية كل ما هو جميل .
٩- الذكريات الجميلة للماضي من : طفولةٍ ، وشبابٍ ، وأبٍ وأم ، وزوجة وأولاد وعائلة، وأقرباء وأصدقاء ، تساعد في نسيان الأحزان والهموم والألآم .
١٠- بر الوالدين في الكبر ورعايتهم ، كما حصل في مقطع : "" عندما كان يحلق الإبن ذقن والده العاجز ، ويداعبه ويمازحه "" ، يثمر في الأحفاد لأبائهم ، كما حصل في مقطع : "" الحفيد عندما كان يرعى أباه المشلول ، ويمسح عنه اللعاب والمخاط ، ويغني له ويمازحه "" .
١١- حب الزوجة والأولاد .
١٢- صلة الأولاد حتى مع طلاق الزوجين ورعايتهم .
١٣- أهمية أختيار المستشفيات الصحية والنفسية ومواقعها للمعاقين : أمام البحر ، وعند الخضرة ، وفِي الجو الطلق المريح .
١٤- الترويح عن المعاق في كل شيء ، بالقرأة له ، والغناء معه ، والسفر به إلى أي مكان يحبه .
١٦- التمريض يفوق التشخيص ، فالممرض هو العضلة للمريض المعاق ، فهو الذي يحركه ، ويطعمه ، ويشربه ، ويغسله وغير ذلك .
١٧- الإخلاص في أداء العمل من : طبيبٍ ، وممرضٍ وغيرهم .
١٨- الطب في تطور ، ولا يقف عند قضيةٍ معينة ، مثل طريقة برايل للمكفوفين ، بل تجاوزها للشلل الدماغي ، وكيف أستطاع من خلال هذا الفيلم : فهم عبارات المعاق عن طريق الأحرف الأبجدية مع رمش العين .
١٩- تفوق الأجانب في مجالات الحياة .
٢٠- غيرة المرأة ، حتى ولو كانت مطلقة .
٢١- وقوف الزوجة مع زوجها لأخر لحظة .
٢٢- يموت الجسد والأثار ، ولكن تبقى الذكرى والقصص والأخبار .
٢٣- الكتاب والقلم ، يصنع المجد والأمم .
٢٤- الموت وفراق الأحباب قدرٌ من رب الأرباب .

وهذا الفيلم يوازي فيلم : "" my left foot “ من حيث براعة التمثيل ، وروعة التصوير ، وأبداع الإخراج .

ولقد أبدع الممثل : ماثيو أماليرك ، في أداء دور المعاق بشكل رائع .",TPlcQfglFJg

Having said that I would love to see campers with omni direction tires and one (or more) with hover craft performance or actual hover craft functionality.  As a kid I recall how hard it was to back a trailer into a camping spot.  Even though my dad was a Lt. Colonel in the Army at the time he cussed at the whole effort every single time.  He was an ace pilot and decorated soldier from the Korean and Vietnam wars.  Backing into a tree lined campsite?

قصته عن : معاق في أسبانيا ، لا يستطيع الحركة ، ولا يستطيع ممارسة الحب ( الجنس ) ، فلا يتحرك منه إلا فمه ، لكنه يتمتع بروح الفكاهة ، يطالب القضاة بحقه في القتل الرحيم ، ويحاول كل من حوله منعه ، وإسعاده في الحياة عن طريق الحب والتواصل واللعب والضحك ، لكنه يصر على قراره في الموت ، وفِي الأخير يموت بالقتل الرحيم .

مضمون الفيلم تطرق لعدة أمور :-

١- نعمة العافية والصحة .
٢- العافية تاج على الأصحاء لا يراها إلا المرضى .
٣- ذوي الإحتياجات الخاصة .
٤- البكاء عن طريق الضحك .
٥- الخوف سلاح قوي يقتل .
٦- الشم يبعث الأحاسيس القوية ( مثل رائحة نسيم البحر ، وعطر المرأة ..... ) .
٧- النفس ملك لله ، وليس للبشر .
٨- الإنتحار ليس الفرار من الأقدار .
٩- الحب ليس مشاعر فقط بل أحاسيس وشهوة .
١٠- شهوة الجنس .
١١- الحالة النفسية أقسى من الجسدية .
١٢- الوداع مثل النار .
١٣- الوحدة أقسى من البرد والنار .
١٤- الموعد المهجور لا ينبت الورد .
١٥- التخيل عالم جميل كالأحلام .
١٦- الذكريات الجميلة راحة وطمأنينة .
١٧- عرض حالات الإعاقة وإنجازات المعاقين ومخاطبة المعاقين للناس عبر وسائل الإعلام تدفع العاجزين والمحبطين والكسولين للنظر للحياة بشكل أخر جميل ومشرق .
١٨- هل القتل الرحيم لمن كان مشلولاً طيلة ٢٨ سنة ( لا يستطيع الحركة ) أو من كان في حالة غيبوبة سنين طويلة : جائز شرعاً أم لا ؟؟؟",dVRnG1MddAM

24215,"On the Revisionist History podcast, Malcolm Gladwell uses this film to illustrate how the best action to take, like running out of the house and leaving the kid with the killer, are often socially-taboo (30m mark).     Like pulling the hockey goalie in order to add another offensive player, if you're down by 2 or more, 12min before the game ends [SSRN/biorxiv]!  

Another great movie is Force Majeure where very early in the movie, a husband runs away from what looks like an oncoming avalanche, leaving the wife and kids behind.   The avalanche never happens, but the rest of the movie, is about the social aftermath of his decision.      

The movie Funny Games, is also interesting in that at no point was there anything that the victims could have done and still acted politely or socially acceptable, until it was too late.     Reminds me of the Warren Buffet's saying about the chains of habits.. and how they are too light to be felt until they are too heavy to be broken!",G5VeowxERwM

24271,"And believe it or not, Cameron Queso - you call her Diaz, but her real last paternal name is Queso - Emilo QUESO Diaz was her father - is a fan. First the Spiderman dance in ""Full Throttle"". Although I may hate that movie cause of Leblanc, it sets the way for something else. She references it again in ""The Holiday,"" co-starring Kate Winslet.

What's so touching is that this could been Cameron's way of thanking Kirsten. There's a video with a young Kirsten Dunst showing love for ""The Mask"" in a childhood video from the year it came again. 

 Cameron > Maria Bello
Kirsten Dunst > Alison Lohman.

Two different women - the former a ""bro""-saying Latina, the latter, well, she's a white girl from Jersey...

Unlike Alison Lohman in ""Flicka"" and Bello. The latter of which has condescenation, at the very least, for the former. The former being a girl so deluded she actually believes that the cast of the movie liked her.

With Cameron and Kirsten this doesn't exist whatsoever. Completely opposite. And the former set the path for the latter.

""Crazy/Beautiful"" also > ""Flicka""",NuUiO85Xva0
24272,"""Crazy/Beautiful"" > ""White Oleander""

24277,"There are so many powerful scenes in this terrific movie.  The poignant scene of the dying American Marine who talks quietly about how he just wants to go home and see his family again; and all the Japanese soldiers nearby who understand English are thinking exactly the same thing.  The scene in Mt. Suribachi when the soldiers are ordered to commit suicide rather than surrender to the Americans is heartbreaking...  many of them have tears in their eyes even as they prepare to detonate their grenades.  Unlike what Americans have thought of all the Japanese soldiers as fanatics, a lot of them were human beings who really did not want to die, but were ordered to.  The last scene in the movie depicts the letters from the doomed soldiers and what they said in them, and is gut wrenching.  More than just about any war picture this movie sensitively depicts the horror, hopelessness and tragedy of war.",51lo2dpaZ_g

It confused me, hahaha! XD I never was able to beat the game at that age, sadly, and I think I want to revisit it now.

The war is something in the past and at the moment the ex-yugoslav countries don't typically act like this because  most people in these countries care about corruption and poverty. If your going to say America fucked Serbs over well they did but at the same time they also fucked over everyone in that region because every nation is still corrupt. Now I know that I said the genocide happened but also some Bosnians committed genocide on Serbs but the main point is that most Serbs or Bosnians living in both nations don't really care about this war anymore and they prob would see this movie anyways.

24854,((    ✝   )) when Beavis and Butt-head Do America came out to the movie theaters. I went and seen it ten times I'm being serious. Anyway I was just thinking about this earlier today. I think that Mike Judd should do another Beavis and Butt-head Movie + I also think that Mike Judd should do all new episodes of Beavis and Butt-head & MTV needs to play them again like they used to. We all Miss watching Beavis and Butt-head on MTV.,jRnVQ4NBXko

24859,Oh my goodness when they came out with Beavis and Butthead the cartoon series on MTV. I thought that was so hilarious don't get me wrong I did watch Beavis and Butt-Head on MTV all the time. I became a big fan of it just like everybody else matter of fact I felt Beavis and Butthead is 20 times better than South Park like seriously. Then when MTV announced that they were doing a Beavis and Butt-head Do America movie I was so hyped up and excited. I seen Beavis and Butthead movie in the movie theaters like 18 times. Now I have Beavis and Butt-head Do America the movie on Blu-ray disc. And now I can't watch any time I want haha hahaha. But anyway I was just thinking I know it's been a long time since Mike Judd had did anything for Beavis and Butthead. I so would love to see Mike Judd do Beavis and Butt-head part 2. Like seriously I wouldn't. I also would love to see MTV do for New Year's Eve and New Year's Day. The whole entire marathon of Beavis and Butthead. Yeah I know I'm asking for a miracle when it comes to MTV but just think about it. A New Year's Eve in a New Year's Day marathon Beavis and Butthead. That's so would rock but I'm not counting on it are holding my breath.,jRnVQ4NBXko

Well, it is important to keep one's humanity, but some put a higher priority on survival, winning, fighting, and not seeing oneself as a victim but as a soldier.

24993,"Hayek in a New York Times   article, wrote, “Harvey Weinstein had become a wizard of a new wave of cinema that took original content into the mainstream. At the same time it was unimaginable for a Mexican actress to aspire to a place in Hollywood… Knowing what I know now, I wonder if it wasn’t my friendship with them – and Quentin Tarantino and George Clooney – that saved me from being raped… Little did I know that it would become my turn to say no. No to opening the door to him at all hours of the night… He [Weinstein] said the words, “I will kill you, don’t think I can’t.” He would let me finish the film if I agreed to do a sex scene with another woman… I agreed to do the senseless scene… I had a nervous breakdown… Until there is equality in our industry, with men and women having the same value in every aspect of it, our community will continue to be a fertile ground for predators.” The film depicts the tragic life of Mexican artist Frida Kahlo.  The making of this film could itself be the subject of a documentary. Luis Valdez (La Bamba, 1987) began his Frida project hoping to use Laura San Giacomo as Frida. The project was crushed after protests citing San Giacomo Non-Hispanic ethnicity. Salma Hayek showed an active interest in playing Frida, seeking out Dolores Olmedo Patino. Through Patino Hayek was able to secure access to Kahlo’s paintings. Hayek recruited Alfred Molina to play Diego Rivera. She approached Harvey Weinstein who took over the project. The soundtrack features Chavela Vargas’ and Lila Downs’ renderings of the Mexican ranchera genre. Biopic, drama, music, romance. US. AA: Original Score, Makeup.

I walked away crying my eyes out. I've been raped seriously and the only dollar show showed this very distasteful piece of crap. Chris Rock belongs back on stand up live, not that I ever saw him in person, but I went for the cute bear scene. The guy I was with sat and ate popcorn and I just tried to not be in the movie scene area. Worst piece of crap ever! NOT funny and NEVER again. P.S

But i'm just being realistic. Hot women always go after men they think are hot. Hot women never have sex with men they think are nerds and soft. Charlize really wanted Patrick Wilson.

I hope there will be secondary book a prequel to answers these questions or may a movie perhaps will suffice. If one looks really close to the painting the girl has tears in her eyes suggesting that the earring was forcefully rammed into her ear for the portrait. No one knows for sure.",8awflTA4QYE

Russia never got what it wanted and it will never get. You should be ashamed of your country since it has a name of aggressor all over the globe.

They are invading us every day!!! They are coming near the capital every fucking day. Georgia ukraine romania and such countries will agree that russian are always invading countries. 


In 2008, our military rushed into south osettia, samachablo and got it back. In my opinion, this was bad decision. Of course it was our land and we had to get it back but not like that. That would mean war between russia and georgia and it did. Ok this was bad decision but it doesnt make us invadors, how are we invador??? Samachablo, south osettia is ours so we have right to be there.

25520,"Y'all from the movie of Heaven is for real, the movie is great, but the lady who said ""Heaven and Hell are just concepts to frighten people"" How can you, you who said that Heaven and Hell are just concepts say that they are just concepts, they are not concepts they are real. Y'all people don't know the truth, y'all are just trying to make a show in church. Let me the tell y'all a few things. #1.Heaven and Hell are NOT concepts to frighten people, Heaven and Hell exist, but those 2 Kingdoms cannot be seen just like Jesus Christ cannot be seen.
#2. The Reverend or pastor of the Church in the beginning of the movie, you said that your not sure if Heaven is real, how can you, preaching the Word of God not believe in Heaven.
#3. The Rapture of the bridegroom do y'all believe in that? (See the following scriptures that talk about the Rapture: 1Thessalonians 4:17, 1Thessalonians 4:16, 1 Corinthians 15:52, Luke 17:34-37, 1 Corinthians 15:51-53, Matthew 24:31, Matthew 25: 1- 46 and Luke 17:35-37) because I do and it will happen before Jesus Christ comes riding on the clouds of Heaven
#4. When the Reverend or pastor fell to the floor, wife Sonya Burpo of the Reverend or pastor, your not supposed to tell your friend ""that lady that said that Heaven and Hell are just concepts to frighten people, your not supposed to tell her sing Amazing Grace, NO! On the contrary your supposed to have the whole Church pray with faith for your husband, not sing Amazing Grace, Why you going to sing Amazing Grace for when your husband is on the floor with his back hurting?
#5. If y'all don't seek for the Holy Spirit in y'all's Church, you should do so. 
#6. Pastor/Reverend Todd Burpo, what does the story of the lion, bear, unicorn and Tiger have to do with the Word of God? 
#7. in this movie your supposed to preach the Word of God 
#8. In the hospital scene Todd Burpo, how can you being a Reverend or a pastor yell at God telling him ""Don't you take my son"", No! you're not supposed to get angry at God, get angry at the Devil he's the one who put the sickness in your son. Or you don't believe in Hell and the Devil who is in Hell? Just like there is such thing as Jesus Christ, there is such thing as the Devil. You supposed to remain in Faith Todd Burpo, not yell at God. But other than that the movie was great it really inspired me",N-ewaCVARtM

25522,"Hi everyone. Long long before this movie came out I was a teenager in the early 1980s. My parents brought me into a old antique store on the Oregon coast. I was bored ""like always with anything old"" so ..I looked around so no one was watching me I pulled out a glass in a box wrapped in a news paper printed printed in 1912. I read a article that a woman was in sugury and that her spirit had lived out of her body....and was hovering over head watching the sugouns performing surgery on her. I was shocked....WOW I am looking around ...no one saw me so quickly wrapped the news paper around the glass and put it back into the box. I said to my self.....this is REAL! not made up! people in that erra were MUCH more honest then today and the stories of ghost were real! since then I have joined a few near death experience groups interviewed no less then 50 members and the stories they say are astounding! not every NDE is the same but the detailed are incredible. Small example: when a person dies and has a NDE the silver cord...cord of life is attached from the body to the soul. It glistens and it needs to stay attacked both to the body and soul in order to return back to the body. If its severed...the soul can never come back to the body. The soul also travels at t he speed of thought...lighting quick. I could go into more detail but the stories I have read are astounding. Ohhh.and try and do the right thing! you ma see you self in a ""life review"" of your life in the afterlife doing thing that are painful to others.",N-ewaCVARtM

Most seeing different places and different things in their near death experience equals LIES being told to the people who experience it. People who haven't had one yet, if you do, please ask what the universe is and why others aren't seeing the same thing you are. Please ask what the point of this experiment is.

There can't be a world full of liars who are all just claiming different stories.

25671,"1989, I was 9 years old and me and 3 friends were going to the movies on a Saturday.
 So, we all were trying for over 2 hours straight to decide on and agree on what to see.
It was between 'Major League', 'Honey, I Shrunk The Kids', 'The Karate Kid Part III', 'Ghostbusters 2', and 'No Holds Barred' with Hulk Hogan and the terrifying Zeus.
   Of course, there were 4 of us and 2 of them wanted to see Ghostbusters 2, but me and the other one chose to see Major League. But they definitely wouldn't let us in, so we decided to buy tickets for 'No Holds Barred' our second choice, and just simply sneak in to watch Major League. After all, we were 9 years old. No way some 20-something movie usher was gonna outsmart us!
But they did, and we got busted. We were stuck watching 'No Holds Barred' but what can I say, it was an awesome movie. 
I loved WWF wrestling (what kid didn't in the late 80's?) but couldn't stand Hulk Hogan. So I was routing for Zeus the entire movie. He was such a bad ass tough guy. Oh man...",K_ILz9bC-VU

I cherish this book and movie. Just a shame the website has changed. It's no longer the same settings, but just a link to this youtube page.

25827,"SPOILERS! SPOILERS! Don't read if you haven't seen the film! 
I have several questions that have fried my brain about this film.  Here are a few:  We know that Mathew M is actually Adam so shouldn't the actor playing the adult Fenton be actually older than MM?
Do you think Fenton was born a serial killer or was he created by all of the trauma Otis/Dad inflicted upon him? The nature vs nurture concept or *Nature and Nurture?
In the beginning adult Fenton shoots himself in the head. Then later we see adult Adam whack Fenton on the head, what did I miss?  
 And. . . Oh and the demon list can be seen above Adam's desk on the cork board with two darkened names at the bottom. I have few questions: A. Does Fenton make his own serial killer list? 2. If yes, ok, but why is the FBI guy on Fenton's list?  Third - If this list is actually Adam's list. . . Why is it on Fenton's board and why aren't the last two names *""Fenton Meiks""* and  *""Wesley Doyle""*?",mW6TlPMHXgk

25841,Kinsey  is and was a disgusting  man. He took records from paedophiles  who RAPED children  to prove  that  children  are sexual from birth and that children  like having sex at a young  age. Also that children between 2 MONTHS AND UP fainting and screaming and convolution and kicking and passing out is there way of having a organism. He took records from  prisoners  and prostitute to prove that most  people in society were having abortions and premarital sex and homosexuality and commiting adultery and rape  experience  when IT was not the case.

25907,"It's such a beautiful movie! 
Lately a lot of people (like The Royal Shakespeare company ) have tried to addapt Will's plays for modern times. I don't like the result- they preserved the original text and dumped some tanks and skyscrapers in the background- horribly artificial in my op.
This version is true and natural- they don't pretend to play Othello, yet they are true to the plot. The story is universal: race- love- betrayal- hot blooded youth- jealousy and death. They didn't just give O a bunch of modern army uniforms and say he was fighting in Syria or smth. They created a whole context where the story could work : teenagers and basketball. At basketall a boy of colour can shine like no other arousing admiration and hatred. 

And the words are modern !  - no posh quotes from Shakespeare- if you want to make everything modern- then modernize it gently and respectfully. I hated "" Romeo and Juliet"" with Di Caprio - the lines uttered by punks on motorbikes sounded soooo false! West Side Story- is a modernized version of R &J ,  but done with delicacy and it has a value of its own. Just like ""O"".",Bz1NIOjkJi0

26036,"Kubrick was an highly enlightened person and also among the Illuminati. He was aware of presence of higher beings  and also orchestrated the studio footage of the 1st lunar landing. The frustration of being put under vow of secrecy he made The Shinning, depicting his own self in Jack Nicholson's character. His understanding of things definitely showcases he being subjected to a immense knowledge & comprehension by a higher being similarly as the apes in the beginning of this movie as well as the astronauts via the monolith on the earth and the moon.",oR_e9y-bka0

You are to set an ambush behind the city. Don’t go very far from it. All of you be on the alert.5I and all those with me will advance on the city, and when the men come out against us, as they did before, we will flee from them. 6They will pursue us until we have lured them away from the city, for they will say, ‘They are running away from us as they did before.’ So when we flee from them, 7you are to rise up from ambush and take the city. TheLord your God will give it into your hand.8When you have taken the city, set it on fire. Do what the Lord has commanded. See to it; you have my orders.”jousha(8:3-8)

26231,"I've been putting of watching this film for so many years because I suspected that it wouldn't be a very realistic
depiction of D-day. But I finally watched it today and...well, it's entertaining, but that's all it is.

The cast is monumental, I'll give it that much. But there's not a single drop of blood to be seen (apart from Richard Burton having a little red stain on his leg at the end), and no guts or brain matter flying around a la Saving Private Ryan.
Of course, this was made in 1962 when such depictions of violence would've been impossible. But still, they didn't
have to make up for the lack of realistic violence with fucking camp humor and boys own macho men with cigars!
This is WWII and NOT bloody Alistair Maclean! But oh no, instead we get Sean Connery acting like a buffoon and making
piss-poor jokes about drowning before getting a chance to fight and bagpipes.

The only people who are portrayed with any dignity are the Germans. They don't fool around with crude jokes and macho
speeches. They are trying to stop the invading forces as best they can, and the seriousness of the situation is very well
portrayed, from the sheer unwillingness to believe the nerve of the allied forces, to the poor leadership demonstrated by
high command (Hitler is sleeping. Don't disturb him).

For being a 60's war film, it's not bad. And the production is indeed enormous on every level.
But it's also as flawed and unrealistic as I feared it would be, and I can't, in all honesty, appreciate it as much as I'd
like as a result.",RW5t1V4xm3M

26287,"I would love to winter camp and the Airstream is way to low to be dragging around in the snow and $70,000 for all the extras on this is worth it. A new base model Airstream will coast at least that.",gDJlwSubTyI
26288,I love the Airstreams but this is a contender. If you look on any Air stream site everyone says that sooner or later they will leak because of all the panels. So I do not look forward to repairing floors and walls. But I still love all those windows!,gDJlwSubTyI
26289,"for 70k, you can buy 3 cabins in different locations and rent them out when your not using them.  You will sell some at 10k- 20K, but no one will pay 70k.",gDJlwSubTyI
26290,Nice thank you for sharing your video from Team Terry rving on YouTube,gDJlwSubTyI
26291,"The big plus to me is the 4 season ability. I definitely would like to see the interior as it just seems be claustrophobic especially because they keep the shades drawn for all of there media shots. One of the big pluses of an airstream is the huge windows, then again the disadvanted of a 4 season trailer as that is a source of heat loss.The only oddity is the front storage tray. It lengthens the trailer probably by a foot. One of the advantages of such a trailer is that it smaller, that means it easier to tow and moves to places longer trailers can't. So you add another foot for such small amount of storage that makes it less compact and adds a long lever action to you tongue weight. Even if it's a great place to put a generator you still have to pick it up out of the tray as they recommend not running the genny in the tray. This tray supposedly saves you from moving the genny from the back of the truck which is right there beside you. In fact you only have to lift it once to put it back in the truck where as the storage tray you have to lift it twice, if this is a weight issue. There really isn't much of an advantage unless you have a real high tail gate but generally the tow vehicles are half tons and don't have a high bed height.",gDJlwSubTyI

26321,"This is my list of favourite Mad Max films:
1: Mad Max 2 - Road Warrior
2: Mad Max 
3: Mad Max - Fury Road
4: Mad Max - Beyond Thunderdome

Thunderdome is my least favourite because of several things, the story seemed really dragged out, and kind of pointless. He didn’t have his interceptor and the action scenes felt kind of weak compared to the others in the franchise. I know he didn’t really have his interceptor in Fury Road but it was in the film a fair bit, just modified and being driven by someone else.
Thunderdome also seems the least “rewatcheable” of the awesome foursome. Like, i could watch Road Warrior non-stop all day and not get tired of it, same with Fury Road, and Mad Max. But i dunno, i just don’t like Thunderdome. At least it wasn’t as bad as it could have been, i mean, when you look at other franchises like Jurassic Park and Star Wars (originals) their thirds films were shockingly bad.

Ok maybe Return Of The Jedi wasn’t that bad... But Ewoks man, Ewoks...",9JKZKjFjHDM

27049,"The teacher was not a 'Shaolin priest,.' He is a Zen priest. At least get the basics correct. If you'd ever met a Transmitted Zen priest, you'd recognize a lot of the same in them as in this teacher. They appear ordinary at first, but, look closer and you'll have the rare opportunity to meet someone who has become something entirely 'extra ordinary.' Very few recognize such individuals when they meet them. It's not an opportunity you should ever turn down. Many of them are hidden in plain sight, or hide their insight (same thing really) and you have to do a lot of work yourself before they'll even begin to actively 'teach' you. When such a person does take you on as a student, you have to work even harder. They see through all the masks, all the bullshit, all the stories that we try to fool ourselves with and will reach right into you and make you open your eyes to reality, which is not the normal, everyday world as we think of it.",gegNMYvY_yg

His character shouldn’t have been a parody of an intelligent straight faced black man (with a stupid voice). He should’ve been more natural and believable character like Carlton or something. The basics of character development were shallow so it feels like this could’ve been a 15 minute short that was drawn out way too much.

This is not supposed to make you laugh or cry this movie is supposed to frighten you as the characters eventually become full sambos. The ending credits is a very sad montage of minstrel show memorabilia, he’s trying to show us that American entertainment is inherently racist",EMZ6zp-3oGY

27308,"The general consensus I've gotten over the years regarding the Police Academy movies are:

1 & 2 - must watch
3 & 4 - overall plot nearly identical, but still watchable

Horrible. It felt forced and tired. And needless to say, you can't replace a Mahoney with Charlie Schlatter (had to look up his name).",F15NcS7NMwY

Like the camera man was trying to replicate real-life/documentary style for the movie, but he didn't have the gears or skill to do it properly? And then the director just went on without fixing this issue since the beginning. Therefore runing the whole movie for me. I never understood that.

27505,"Eh looks all right. Not something I would hunt down to watch but I would view it if it's on. Just seems a bit conflicted with it's intent. It looks like it's trying to play up the culture clash for comedy but then you have a bad guy rolling into town intent on killing everyone till the hero shows himself.

I also get whiffs of ""trying too hard"" from Paul Gross' character. I don't care who you are or what time period you're in, no gunman back in the day would just casually put his weapon on the table and make a crack about killing people for food. I mean Clint Eastwood in Pale Rider took out a thug with an axe shaft, no bladed head or anything he just spun it smoothly and knocked the guy out in two hits. In High Plains Drifter he only shoots one man, the rest of the posse were taken out by Clint's traps and psychological tricks. In neither case did Clint come off as a stupid drunk. Or take Raylan Givens from Justified. The guy is a sharp dresser and very soft spoken. My point is Paul Gross doesn't feel like the protagonist of a Western so much as one of the henchmen who left the gang before the hero got a chance to shoot him.

In fact, part of the fun of a culture clash is having the two sides come to grips with each other meanwhile the trailer seems to imply that the American is a violent, gun obsessed, uncouth, killer while the Canadians are an almost saccharine idyllic community of gentlemen and proper ladies; making one the superior culture. That seems unfair and I would say the same if the roles were reversed. Why not have the American character impulsive and jump to conclusions that make him misjudge the situation and then look silly for being so eager to take action? Or have one of the Canadians being so polite and accommodating he or she apologizes for genuine insults or hostile intent? That's funny and taking more accurate shots at both sides and cultural satire only works if the cultures in question can see themselves being represented in the exaggeration.

Then again I could be wrong and the trailer is rather misleading. I hope that's the case.",QK-Md46Exxs

يحكي عن : محنة كبيران في السن ، الزوجة تصيبها أمراض تقدم العمر من :
1- رعاش .
2- زهايمر .
3- شلل نصفي .
4- جلطة قلبية .
5- سكتة دماغية وغيرها .
والزوج كبير في السن ، لكنه يقوم برعايتها ، فلم يتركها تذهب للمستشفى ، أو إلى ملجأ العجزة ، بل قام بكل الحب بما يقوم به أي محب لحبيبه ، حتى أصبحت طفلاً عديم الحيلة ، يصنع لها الطعام والشراب ، ويأكلها ، ويغسلها ، ويذهب بها إلى الحمام ، ويغير حفاضاتها ، ويدلك جسمها بالكريم لأجل : ألا يتهرى جسدها ويقسو ، ويقص عليها الحكايات ، ويقرأ لها الأخبار ، ويغني لها ، ثم بعد ذلك لا ينام بسبب صوت شخيرها ، فأصبح لها أباً وأماً وأخاً وأختاً .
وهذه القصة موجودة أيضاً بالعكس في مئات الأفلام : فتجد الزوجة هي من تقوم بذلك لأجل زوجها المريض .
ومعاني ومقاصد الفيلم واضحة بما تحمله من : حب ، وتفاني ، وعطاء ، وصبر ، وتحمل ، وعناء ، وشقاء ، وعدم التذمر من الأخطاء والتكرار .

I've asked them about the Canadian health care system, and they have told me the main issue/ drawback of universal coverage is that major operations, such as to remove a tumor or an organ transplant have much longer waiting lists.

28222,"The music is not that bad, but the reason why the movie sucked was because of a lot of cliches, I just saw it today. I actually somewhat liked the character of Billie Frank, introverted but mysterious, but the thing I didn't like was that there was not much complexity or character development of her, or anyone else. The movie was really slow, and the supporting cast was irritating (her dancer friends and PR team). Mariah's acting wasn't too bad, but sometimes it wasn't convincing, like the time she found out that her boyfriend died, and she just had a sad expression like she lost her car keys. But, none of that is as bad as the fact that at one point, Dice becomes abusive, he becomes possessive and controlling and jealous, and insults her friends. When he fights with her he tries to guilt trip her. But then the movie just sort of forgives him and plays it like he's some tragic hero, and he really loved her, and in the end she says how she took him for granted, like wtf!! He was literally abusing her! And the movie shows the abusive relationship as just another relationship which has problems. It was actually apologising for an abuser. Even this trailer says how it's about ""enduring love"" and what not, but it's not, Dice becomes really manipulative at one point. Now, I love Mariah just as much as the next person, I've listened to all her albums, I didn't like this though...",QaKxGrajnzY

They modernized it and made some changes for example when it comes to music choices and dancing. But why not? I like that the movies are not 100 % alike. Some like the original more, others prefer the remake. Nothing wrong with that:) I don't really have a preferance.

Mayer---the head of MGM---sensed a left-wing plot in the script to compare Nero to conservative leaders of the day. HOwever, even with the changes in the script and the leads, he might've been right.

28460,"The case was just re-opened by the FBI in January '18 after a letter claiming to be from one of the Anglin brothers reached their offices.  There have been many hoaxes over the years, but this one was full of what seem to be legitimate details.  Anglin wrote that they barely made it to Angel Island that night, the brothers ran off together, Morris alone.  The Anglin family refused to help law enforcement and sent along a photo of 2 men they claimed were the brothers in Brazil.  Apparently they lived there, in Fargo and Minot N.D. for years and Seattle as well.  According to the letter they kept in touch w/ Morris who died in 2008, followed by Anglin's brother in 2011.  The last survivor's reason for writing the letter was to make a deal stating that he would come forward if he received treatment for his cancer and had to serve no more than a year in prison.  The Feds spent years analyzing the letter, but they tried to avoid embarrassment by concluding the results were ""inconclusive"".  If so, why do they need to re-examine a cold case and announce that the 3 escapees are subject to arrest and prosecution until they are 99 years old?",KSS0fH9zzFY

28620,"Movie is a masterpiece in its own right,& great satire, great yuppie& our narcissistic culture analysis, almost 2 decades before Wolf of Wall Street. The book was more violent, but people here seem to not understand they couldn't show everything like in the book, especially in 2000. This film aroused great controversy at the time. And yes, it is still brutal. You can never match the book, cinema has its limitations unlike literature. In any book you can write everything, film is limited by time, money or what can be shown on the screen (content rating). I don't know if you know that the director had to cut some of the controversial scenes from Amercian Psycho in 2000, when the movie first came out. The movie & the novel were simply ahead of its time. Coz even the scenes filmed then - it was too much for ppl. I was old enough, I remember the scandal that this film caused. So u must be very young, and new generation  is used to brutal violence in the cinema, back then - different times.
Still ,movie is brilliant. Bale showed crazy determination to play this role and he was f brilliant in it, totally underrated role, should be Oscar nomination really. These 2 artciles explain in great way how genius this book&movie were : https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/27/theater/in-hindsight-an-american-psycho-looks-a-lot-like-us.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBale%2CChristian http://www.womenandhollywood.com/sharing-our-story-mary-harrons-misunderstood-cult-classic-american-psycho/",5YnGhW4UEhc

28622,I was really disappointed I read the book then decided to watch the movie and they cut out so many scenes it literally made no sense . This could have been an amazing film but they cut out the more gore parts and some scenes that actually tie the story together . The movie makes no sense and the plot it basically non existent!! If you’ve only watched the movie read the book it’s way better . Also the scene with the rat is one of the most interesting and detailed and it’s not even mentioned in the movie,5YnGhW4UEhc

An homage to  Murnau' Nosferatu sometime quoting his aesthetics and camera angles, yet a totally originally work of ist own.

Absolutely beautiful, and they're right that its the most human movie I've seen in a while. There's no falsifying, no washing over its own awkwardness, and it just embraces that concept and runs with it, even making some very funny scenes out of it at the same time. Also, I really loved that this film explored mental illness and disorders and how that can cause people's relationships to deteriorate over time, and I believe the films says that Michael is genuinely mentally ill.

The scenery is beautiful, the cast is superb, but so much is left to the audience to figure out on their own, that you are often left scratching your head. You are never given a reason to care about the mother or son... there is no foray into their characters, only surface facade. The mother seems to be saying goodbye to her son, and you're like ""WTF?"" It feels like a book that someone has randomly torn pages out of. And the ending? Wholly unsatisfying – and over in a New York Minute!",bQ2LIDwQ49U
28903,Just saw this movie on cable. Never heard of it but the cast is was drove me to see it. Performances were top notch but I found the story rather confusing and the ending rather dull. It's basically two stories being told though out the movie. I'm not sure why it had to be basically in an arctic setting but that added to the dreariness of the story line. I'm like no wonder these people are depressing if they have to live in a ice bowl.,bQ2LIDwQ49U

29367,This is so incredibly relevant today with the neo-McCarthyism going on in US discourse right now. Hatred of Trump (while valid in my opinion) has been warped into this narrative of Anti-Russia as if we're at war with them again when we're not.

I rather found the Brosnan flicks pretty awful, as were QOS and Spectre from Craig, the Lazenby one, and there are even some Connery ones that i don't really like, Thunderball f.i. is a long, terrible bore! besides Moore, i liked Timothy Dalton the best as 007, although i think TLD is not a really good movie, but licence to kill ranks, for me, at the top of the best Bond-films, together with The spy who loved me. The Moore ones i all enjoyed (and still does!), as i did with Goldfinger, you only live twice, diamonds are forever, rather bad but very enjoyable!, and Never say never again from the Connery ones.
Moore, dalton and connery are great bonds, but lazenby, craig and brosnan made not much impression on me, i think they are all 3 terrible Bonds!",gF5fr3Zhi7E

29578,"I saw the film, and though I think Willem Dafoe is an excellent actor, I think the film is a gross insult to Christianity.

Jesus was fully human, which means he had all the feelings and temptations as we all do, but the difference was he was a perfect man, he wasn't ruled by his feelings.

So even though he had all the natural feelings and desires of all men, he never succumb to them, nor did he ever entertain the idea of them, but kept his mind on his mission, which was fulfilling all the prophecies written about him, and then dying to redeem mankind from sin.

That being said, while I do not like the film in itself, because it takes such as our departure from the four gospels in the Bible, there are a couple things that I do like about Willem Dafoe's portrayal of Jesus.

Things I liked about Mr. Dafoe's portrayal are...

#1:  Most of all the other actors who portrayed Jesus acted way to austere. Almost like Jesus was like Mr. Spock from Star Trek - completely devoid of emotion.

Whereas with Willem's portrayal, Jesus seems like a man who laughs and cries, just like any other man, and like someone who takes care of his own needs.

His portrayal is makes Jesus feel like someone we can all relate too!

#2: Many of the other actors who portrayed Jesus were way to thin and pale. They made Jesus look almost sickly.

Willem on the other hand, though he is slender, he still looks healthy. And therefore he makes Jesus look both healthy and strong enough, that he could've been a carpenter back then.

From what I've read about carpentry work, back then it was a very physically demanding job. 

Not to mention the fact that people back then walked everywhere they went, and the terrain around that area was often times rocky and hilly.

So that in itself is gonna require being in good physical health, and a degree of strength.

#3: Most of the other actors who portrayed Jesus, their costumes were always pure white, and had this almost strange glow to them.

Where as Willem's Jesus not only has some color to his wardrobe, but also his clothes don't have any real glimmer to them.

Not to mention, but when other actors in films have portrayed Christ, it seems like they've always tried to make their voice sound more robust or unique in some way, where is Willem Dafoe just simply talks normally. So it makes his Jesus more like an average guy.

He looks and sounds basically like an average guy you might see walking down the street back then, until you notice the way that he lives his life, and the way that he talks, not just the sound of his voice.

I think that Willem could've played Jesus in the spirit of how he did here, while the filmmakers could've still stuck to what was written in the Bible.",qJKxg4p-Alk

29620,"I loved this show forward and backwards (well not literally backwards).  I have visited much of French Polynesian, Tonga, Fiji, Vanuatu, and lived in Samoa for 4 years.  This show depicted so much of what I found different and beautiful about the polynesian people (yes technically Vanuatu is not in Polynesia but they consider themselves to be connected to the islands and often call themselves polynesian).  

In Tahiti more than one woman asked my mother if they could borrow her husband so he could ""share his seed"" with them.  They did not want to 'keep' him, just get his 'seed'.  

Their generous hearts changed the person I am now.  I still remember how much they loved my family even when we had just been there for a few weeks (as we traveled through).  They opened their homes to us, let us sleep on their fine mats and were totally and completely beautiful.  I miss their hospitality.

I lived through 2 hurricanes when I lived in Samoa, and weeks without a supply ship coming in.  We had stores, but their shelves were very soon empty, fruit trees were knocked down, and if a supply ship had not have come we would have been in big trouble.  

I remember that the Mormons were one of the first people to send supplies, even before FEMA got there. 

I will definitely show this to my kids.",5dKsHYzIoUI
29621,"Don't support Mormon false religion by watching this! 
Having spent weeks on a Christian mission trip in 1993 I saw first hand the sadness grief + loss caused by the Mormon organisation who have ripped off the families of this beautiful place of Tonga and wherever else they have spread their false messages! They do NOT carry + spread the Truth + Grace of the Good News of the Gospel of Christ .......instead spread an evil message of temptation to the Islanders there to join up to their Salt Lake City/ Utah rubbish! 
I met women whose husbands had left for Utah, USA to get ""work"" and have opportunity to marry again - Moron Mormons can have several 'wives' Also the MM's build free schools and basketball courts to entice and deceive the young Islanders into Mormonism + imprison them into their gump doctrines. Anti-Bible Anti-Freedom!
What a mess they make of the Freedom of the True Gospel of Jesus Christ that came to these Islands - and other places from the London Missionary Society representing our Father God and the Good News in the 1850's when the first King of Tonga was converted to Christianity and stopped cannibalism and other ungodly practices for his kingdom of Tonga.Not a fake 'saviour' like Joseph Smith!
Had to search for the origins of this Disney movie - it's not obvious but what missionary wears a suit with a tie? Yep the same Mo..ons that walk Australian/world streets on their dangerous 'sales' jobs!

This is a retelling of it, far from being the first film made of the story and will not be the last. Disney's Frozen was loosely based on the story, but the characters names and the actual story was re-written to suit. Disney was doing what they do best - FAIRY TALES! like Snow White, Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, etc. My favourite version of The Snow Queen was a stop-motion live animation made by the BBC in 2005.",HJrTHEDgHfY

30193,Man I wish the 2nd film we got should of been a direct sequel to o'bannons classic. If it was me and I got the budget and became a director for the film I would of made it a pure scary war zombie movie with its dark comedy with the zombies and kind of give some hope knowing humans can survive this style of a zombie apocalypse i would've still use the same style of o bannons zombies and i would make the hordes big and the sounds of there moans and screaming out crying for brains would sounds ghostly terrifying though it still can have a hopeless ending situation but I would have it to give the humans the chance to fight back against the zombies with swords and pretty much they can dismember the corpse Becuaee you still have a chance at sliceing the rotten flesh and escaping they can be defeated if you have swords and a acid gun to blind em so you have the full advantage to cut em to piece and still can get away. I wrote a script hat was a direct sequel and it took me 4 years of my high school to write but it was worth the time. My friends even thought it was a great script. I hope one day this franchise gets a new movie studio owner like New Line Cinema of even Blumhouse or hell even A24 the one company that did green room. The visual of there films are beautiful.,KeSAFGWzft8

As the movie goes on the stakes get higher and the movie gets more exciting. Its a fun adventure that you cant help but enjoy. Not to mention that the comedy is so cheesy that its actually. The highlight of the movie is when Fogg is in San Francisco, where was just robbed. As you this man in despair thinking that he will never fulfill his dream, find the woman he loves, and win the bet. At that time when he has fallen into the most low moment in his life, he is found by his best friend and his love interest. They proved him that  man with a dream so big can not do that much alone. Even at his worst he discovers how much he means to those people. Even at his lowest he has already traveled a distance in a period that no man has ever done before. And when you see how thousands of americans believe in him that he could do what no man had done before that is the greatest moment of this film.

A Nightmare on elms street 5 the dream child has great acting. The acting the the Friday the 13th reboot is only okay. But it could have been better. A Nightmare on elm street 5 the dream child is better then first 4 movie of A Nightmare on elm street. A Nightmare on elm street 5 the dream child is better then Friday the 13th.,LFm_jiI8RiA
30314,"This is a great movie. It is better then first 4 movies of A Nightmare on elm street. This is better then any of Friday the 13th movies, It is better then any of the Halloween movies. This is one of the scariest movies from the 80's",LFm_jiI8RiA

30317,the best part of the movie is when the song Bring your daughter to the slaughter starts,LFm_jiI8RiA
30318,After Dream Warriors this series really fell off. Freddy was at his scariest in Part 1 and 2 to me but as the series went on he just became more of a clown making corny jokes. I'd still watch an Elm street marathon on tv though because they're all entertaining.,LFm_jiI8RiA
30319,"Unfortunately it got really corny . And this started it. Wasn't the worst in the series. For me it's

and

NOES part 4",LFm_jiI8RiA
30320,"Hey, yo, this isn't a Wes Craven film. He wrote and directed 1 and New Nightmare, and he wrote Dream Warriors. He had almost nothing to do with this film (aside from probably cashing a ""based on characters created by"" check).",LFm_jiI8RiA

30322,"The Wrestler is a masterpiece of sensibility. The movie totally is on two fundamental points for the human beings: human relationship and the personale talent.

a shame indeed of the owner taking all the profits for his greedy self",61-GFxjTyV0
30324,I can’t wait to finally watch this film,61-GFxjTyV0
30325,"I agree with nearly 100% of the comments-this was a very powerful movie portraying the darker, lonelier and more painful aspects of a sport that constantly gets ridiculed by the masses as ""fake"" and ""phony"".  Sure, the stories are phony and the moves are rehearsed,  and the fans love their heroes and their favorite sport like no other.

However, when it's 20-25 years later, and your body is broken and you're always a step away from collapse and the lights are no longer on you and the fans have moved on, where do you have to go and what can you do?  The Wrestler is a very human story about a man, not an athlete, and it's one of the damn BEST there ever was!",61-GFxjTyV0
30326,"This movie was basically The Rebirth of Mickey rourke's career while he was gone for 15 years, while many said he would never act again and thought his career was basically over I think he could identify a lot with the character and the part towards the end when he gave the speech before his last fight I believe the director allowed him to write that part himself, Proving that Rourke did feel pain and the emotions that are involved with a comeback and a finality. Mickey has always been one of my favorite actors since the days of Angel heart and year of the dragon and I'm glad that he was given the chance to least prove to all of us that he wasn't finished and can still Master his craft all these years later",61-GFxjTyV0

30355,"""A Mighty Wind"" is one fascinating artifact. So much has changed since this memorial concert was staged in 2003. For instance, over the last 15 years, Irving Steinbloom is still a dead person. The Folksmen wound up accepting trannism, long before it was cool. Mitch still doesn't remember much. And musical abuse in general, has actually increased. Which is why I still love this movie, more than ever. Yes, still more than ever!",ujUehfDYkfU

With a very original plot and a great cast I kept waiting for it to take off. It never did, it actually got worse as it went on. It is a real shame because I could see myself loving this film. It lacked emotion and continuity, and thirty minutes after watching it I am already forgetting it.

Don McKay (Thomas Haden Church) travels home when he receives a letter from his high school girlfriend, Sonny (Elisabeth Shue), after leaving his birthplace over 25 years ago. She wants him by her side as she lives out her final days. A few crazy people, Don's secretive past, loneliness, a quirky cab driver, and a mishmash of lies all combine into a crazy mind numbing ride. 4 out of 10.",cDJi2d_iSlk

But it either is, or it is not...Given that there is one sin for which you cannot be forgiven, perhaps that is why the forgeries were created?  So that when a person said, ""This is rubbish"", technically, he would be speaking truthfully when referring to a New International Version, an RSV, Book of Mormon, New World Translation, etc.... For if you remove one word, or add a word, to a verse then it can no longer be called, His Word... for He did not say that.  So, perhaps the Bible is hid for ""their safety"" - but that does not mean you should not SEEK His Words.  As Jesus said, Seek and YE shall find... Others may attempt to seek BUT they will not find, for it is NOT given unto them to find... And so, what was the intent behind creating all those forgeries called bibles?  Was it to ""save life""?  I do not believe so.  They created those forgeries to advance an agenda :  Namely, usury, slavery, murder-death-kill, theft of property, especially land, and to treat many as ""non-persons"". They created those forgeries so that they might continue to do the devil's work without facing a ""robots' rebellion"".",TYiYHfciJwE

Mark 10:29-31 KJV
[29] And Jesus answered and said, Verily I say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my sake, and the gospel's, [30] But he shall receive an hundredfold now in this time, houses, and brethren, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands, with persecutions; and in the world to come eternal life. [31] But many that are first shall be last; and the last first.

Jesus explains that the Gospel is what saves you. Some will believe in the blood of Christ first, some will believe last...either way , faith in our a Lord & Savior, Jesus Christ (The Gospel), is what gets you into heaven. 

Matthew 19:23-26 KJV
[23] Then said Jesus unto his disciples, Verily I say unto you, That a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven. [24] And again I say unto you, It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God. [25] When his disciples heard it , they were exceedingly amazed, saying, Who then can be saved? [26] But Jesus beheld them , and said unto them, With men this is impossible; but with God all things are possible.

Concerning the rich man, it is impossible for him to go to heaven, but what if he believed the gospel? Then, he would go to heaven, but he won't be money rich because he would've shared his riches to those in need and live a simple life believing God and the better riches in heaven. ""with God all things possible, with man it is IMPOSSIBLE to enter the Kingdom of God."" man vs God, guess who wins?
Had the writer of this filthy movie understood this, he/she would never had wrote it...or may be they would have - people write anything for money.

God can save any man who will BELIEVE...

Romans 10:9-10 KJV
[9] That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. [10] For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.

It's not even ""horror"" in the basic sense, definitely more of a suspense/thriller but very good. I mean to have a good plot and storyline is an achievement in itself these days. I personally think what makes it so scary is the whole ""what if"" part of your brain being triggered. Everyone has their own opinion of course but to be completely honest I made the mistake of watching it alone at night and I'm a 30 year old man who loves scary movies but this definitely had me a little shook lol Like I said highly recommend it to anyone especially a fall night with a date 😉",saHzng8fxLs

In an extremely entertaining fashion this director of the film Jeff Tremaine does a great job at truly capturing the idiotic  yet enticing actions of the Bam Margera, Ryan Dunn, Johnny Knoxville and friends.I value the simple yet artistic manner in which this film portrays the group of friends which is obvious Observatory film but the subtle involvement of Jeff Tremaine adds a hint of Participatory film. This is a dynamic thats truly unique and i believe it was used the correct way with this documentary.

He is very well educated ,genius engineer, well behaved but has a darkness insite.People said he's noble,not really.
He killed hundreds of sailors without a blink of an eye (book), he then suffered, played the organ, even (in the book) we know he was crying, some time had nervous breakdown, the captain was not emotionally stable (probably through his tragic past) but hellish intelligent. He treated Ned like a ball (book) and I'm sure he would leave him in the water if not a professor. If Ned will be a woman captain would probably save him, but Ned was a man and it was proboscale (book) because he was curious,loud, and he tried to run away.
Captain in the book is not killed.
The parts of the  book is ""The children of Captain Grant,"" ""20,000 Leagues Under the Sea"" and ""Mysterious Island"".",Xhyuey4xU3Q

31306,"'How to prepare for paranormal activity and still screw up'. I only watched it just now, and I understand why the movie is so controversial. It doesn't matter wether the movie is about how far the paranormal could potentially push a person to lose grip on reality - I just didn't 'feel' the movie. Ultimately it doesn't matter how much a movie exploits a potentiality, if one doesn't enjoy watching it. Rest is a SPOILER, so be warned:

Would you seriously just assume you're conjuring up your fiancee and just stab him in the neck with a glass shard, without checking first - blindly assuming its an hallucination? When you're even remotely an out-of-the-box thinker you should've figured that the mirror could do things you wouldn't be able to predict. Even when they realized it could temporarily have them perform activities they weren't aware of, they still CHOSE to stick around. Its one thing to be stuck in a brilliant illusion, its another thing to simply make stupid decisions. Like many horrors, I feel their choices just didn't make sense. Many times one of the most frustrating things is that horrors contain characters that are either stupid or mentally weak. I love the occasional strong character that fights back. I thought it would happen in this movie... but it didn't. Pointless ending, making the boy end up back where he started.

However one wants to sugarcoat how brilliantly this movie is... it was just frustrating for me to watch. The frustrating part was partly in the truth of how society works. If you remember something correctly... but something that most people can't accept... they'll just 'shrink' you down and make you swallow enough pills until you're acceptable for the rest of society. 'We will only believe your story if its within our paradigm of what we're comfortable with.' So yeah, lucky boy. At the end of the movie he now knows whats in store for him.

31359,This movie is one of the best romance and horse films that I have ever seen. I still of the original VHS tapes and the soundtrack is so beautiful. I still find it fascinating that they sent tom Burlinson and the horse Denny off the cliff and that it was shot in one take. That is a gutsy move and it is what makes the movie more authentic.,Nqlz6lOLtIQ

I meam we see Thomas suffering specific attacks of sort at the beginning of the movie and The Goddes cals  him „Her child“. I guees that regarding the ending Thomas actually IS that woman’s child, I mean physically. I believe Malcolm ain’t the first person discovering the island reather Thomas’s father discovered that place long time ago. Falling in love with the misterious woman and some time after running away with offsprings. When Malcolm found that woman she was decimated but with a smile on her face maybe expecting return of someone beloved. Instead becomming victim of torturers. Same as twin’s father. That’s what usually happens whe two in love are separated. I don’t know. I kinda feel this plot branch was actually in the movie but for some reason was maybe cutted out??

31416,"It's such a beautiful movie! 
Lately a lot of people (like The Royal Shakespeare company ) have tried to addapt Will's plays for modern times. I don't like the result- they preserved the original text and dumped some tanks and skyscrapers in the background- horribly artificial in my op.
This version is true and natural- they don't pretend to play Othello, yet they are true to the plot. The story is universal: race- love- betrayal- hot blooded youth- jealousy and death. They didn't just give O a bunch of modern army uniforms and say he was fighting in Syria or smth. They created a whole context where the story could work : teenagers and basketball. At basketall a boy of colour can shine like no other arousing admiration and hatred. 

And the words are modern !  - no posh quotes from Shakespeare- if you want to make everything modern- then modernize it gently and respectfully. I hated "" Romeo and Juliet"" with Di Caprio - the lines uttered by punks on motorbikes sounded soooo false! West Side Story- is a modernized version of R &J ,  but done with delicacy and it has a value of its own. Just like ""O"".",Bz1NIOjkJi0
31417,I believe this movie is underrated,Bz1NIOjkJi0
31418,I could have sworn this was the young Ashton Kutcher.,Bz1NIOjkJi0
31419,"O was originally meant to be released in 1999 by its original distributor Miramax Films because it was filmed in 1998, but due to the columbine high school massacre Miramax shelved it for 2 years. It wasn't until 2001 when Lionsgate bought it from Miramax that it was released",Bz1NIOjkJi0

Michael is still missing. Many people believe him to be dead, but I think someone hid him away after the noise. Someone who keeps Michael, protects him, tries to control him and if there's one thing I know you can't control evil. You can lock it up, you can burn it, bury it and pray that it dies, but it never will, it just rests a while. You can lock your doors and say your prayers at night but the evils out there, waiting.

31556,"I saw this movie yesterday, for the first time. It's very well-made, the cast is great, the nostalgic atmosphere, the music, the rhythm of the dialogues, really good. But I have a problem with the story and the characters. Was I expecting too much? All these guys are complete idiots and their lives are so meaningless that you could drop a bomb on that diner and nobody would miss them. I couldn't really identify or feel any empathy because they're all too stupid, too empty. (Except that guy whose girlfriend is pregnant and he wants to be included in her and kid's life - is that Billy? - anyway, that situation has some kind of meaning, it has past, future, some drama and consequences.) All the rest - the ""dick-in-the-popcorn"" creep, the destructive idiot in the manger, the records-in-the-alphabetical-order anal freak, the sports-quiz-before-marriage lazy mama's boy asshole? I guess they're supposed to be funny, but they're not. The characters of any decent sitcom have more depth and sense of purpose and the jokes are way better. Is this a ""guy's movie""? It was embarrassing to watch. Guys from my high school had more brains, more soul and more sense of humour than these morons (and I mean while we were in high school).",dGZZ-CLphCI

Damn man. I was so tiny. The VHS's use to be stored under this desk I was only slightly taller than. I could walk under it and now im like triple the height

I remember the movie was so fucking bad ass!! The evil Digimon looked actually evil and pretty scarey. The animation was soooo good aswell!!! When I look at it now it looks kinda shitty with a shit story but at the time it was so complicated to me. Fighting a virus inside a digital world was mad

For some reason I thought the animation was way better tho like this looks worse than Pokémon movie 1 for example. Maybe it's the vids quality. If not, fuck mayn. In 10 years I'll probably be saying the quality of shit I saw in 2018 was bad.

Anyway this was actually so dope to see again. I kinda wanna go back and watch it for the first time again. I'm not even sure where I watched it which is kinda shocking.

But all my relatives lived in the capital Algiers and had been traumatized. One of my family member, a surgeon, was kidnapped from their home in front of spouse and kids, and was taken to the mountains to treat terrorists who have been injured. I have watched this movie few weeks ago, and enjoyed it. But I was disappointed they didn't show the lives of the majority of Algerians as well as the capital. Also a bit of background on what was going would have helped. So many intellectuals have been killed, journalists, authors, artists. During the entire civil war the rest of the world stayed silent and ignored it until it hit their own countries. We started using the term terrorists in the 90's before it was used in North America or Europe. The government has also committed so many exactions. Both sides committed atrocities.",zrIyn3yuip4

31873,"I have to say that all Ayn Rand novels and Atlas Shrugged especially are guilty pleasures for me. IMO, it's hilarious how much time she spends in the books explaining what she doesn't like (Communism, Socialism, Social Democracy or any type of regulation) and none at all to explain what she likes -savage Capitalism. Even John Galt's last speech is a lot like that. I saw the first film, but at that time it was thought that the second film wouldn't get made because it was a flop, and the guy financing it had had some kind of financial trouble or other. I want to see the second and third parts. I want to see how the film handles John Galt's capture and torture. SPOILERS AHEAD Rand's ending in her book was that the government finally captures John Galt and interrogates him. The economy is in such a bad state that they TORTURE Galt so that he would TELL the government what to do to get out of their predicament. They want him to become President in the shadows, I guess. When I read that I couldn't believe it and I laughed out loud. The question I'm dying to make is: WHAT THE HELL HAD Ayn Rand SMOKED THAT DAY?",GSJNU41h5Cg

31877,"Spoiler: when the government capture John Galt they use a ridiculously overly elaborate torture device on him that doesn't even work; they could have just used drugs. 

Yes, the movies are a bit low budget, but they have been contemporised quite well for today's audience and they do convey how exploitative, corrosive and wrong Socialism is, especially when it parasitically infiltrates a Capitalist economy. 

People need to remember that Ayn Rand grew up in Communist Russia, found America a paradise in comparison, hated the cunts trying to introduce Communism in America and was completely flabbergasted that the average American couldn't see the lethal danger of Communism. Unfortunately the Communist Propaganda division did a good job in smearing her name, much as they did with McCarthy, and now many just think of her as the queen of selfishness and never look deeper.",GSJNU41h5Cg
31878,"Each movie got worse and worse. The first was the best in my opinion, the most blockbuster of all 3. The second was like a direct to video rip off. And this one was like a made for TV abomination. I'm glad they got to finish the story but I hope to God this is remade in the future with the same cast from beginning to end. Although the book sits on my shelf I have not read it, does the novel devolve into romantic puss in the third act like this entire film? Very disappointing closer for the trilogy in my honest opinion. I didn't have a problem with the cast change, but this felt like they had $3 left and didn't wanna leave us hanging for a conclusion which I appreciate, but too many news montages and I just can't believe this is the finale the first 2 films were leading up to. John Galt's speech was underwhelming, though I understand it had to be cut down for the film?",GSJNU41h5Cg

Was cause I was watching it while we were doing it. Just had to look this up to show my wife that it was this movie.. but as far as a review... I mean if you like British suspense. It’s not terrible. But if you are looking for like blow your mind crazy movie.. you won’t find it here. As an 18 year old who didn’t care for these types of films, I didn’t like it.

I never understood why so many people make a big deal about Kris Kristofferson not physically looking the part .
That one minor ""negative"" is far , far outweighed by a long list of ""positives"" :
1) PROBABLY , the best soundtrack in a Western - ever 
2) WITHOUT A DOUBT , the greatest ensemble of character actors , ever assembled in a Western 
( Richard Jaeckel , Chill Wills , Jason Robards , R.G. Armstrong , Luke Askew , Jack Elam , L.Q. Jones , Slim Pickens , Harry Dean Stanton )
3) AWESOME exterior landscape  photography
4) FANTASTIC ACTION SCENES  ( jail break , shootout at house by the river )
5) MEMORABLE DIALOG / QUOTES :
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070518/quotes/?tab=qt&ref_=tt_trv_qu
6) and to get more direct about Kristofferson , while he may have physically not been historically correct , imo , he made up for it in spades ,
by giving his character the correct dose of a charismatic figure other men would follow . ( name a true 23 year old actor in 1973 that could pull that off ? )",a-e47wAkg9g

32535,"I love Anne with an E, but this version will always be my favorite. I feel an overwhelming sense of comfort, joy, and nostalgia as I watch the trailer. Such a beautiful, timeless classic. This version, in my opinion,  does Lucy Maud Montgomery the best justice. I truly feel like Anne is my kindred spirit with Megan Follow's portrayal. Just perfect. I love Amybeth but she portrays Anne in a more quirky, dramatic light (however, she might develop as seasons progress), while Megan Follows really portrays the poetic, romantic side of Anne that I love.",czJi_FpLBYY

As well as occasional reference to Anne; and Gilbert guest starring in an episode. Also, Davy and Dora Keith are adopted by Marilla. I also love the new characters, Sara, Felicity, Peter, Cecily, Felix, Andrew...etc. If you haven't watched it, definitely check it out. It is just so beautiful of a show.",czJi_FpLBYY

I cannot imagine many film parts that would allow her all those bigger than life ""reactions""....""gestures""....and ""cartoon like expressions"" that are meant to be played to the back of a full house!!  She had a lot of talent.  What she needed was some control and some formal acting training.     She once stated that she thought she was an ok singer and dancer but thought herself an excellent actress.  I disagree.  I feel, with proper training, she was a very good singer.  She was also a good dancer.  She was a good ""stage"" comedic actress but needed much training to adapt herself to film or dramatics.  She also had great energy!!",8GJHCicaOs0

Therefore, I'll give myself a liberty to say that this was/is indeed a near-perfect film!

32755,"Nobody should judge anyone and it sounds to me that Ben couldn't stand his life! Life isn't about living and learning its more about pain and what has happened to you! People do drugs to self medicate and they have no other choice, when people hit rock bottom they still keep going down a spiral and they are trapped. desperate, alone and nobody cares.A lot homeless people are mentally ill and they live out on the streets! They get attacked all the time, one time a couple of teenagers set a homeless man on fire and video taped it! They got life in prison and death! Whatever faults people may have when they make mistakes people judge them and that is wrong b/c nobody is perfect not even family! You know I never drank but if I hit rock bottom I would probably do what Ben did just say fuck it! Nobody cares, I chose not to drink! Drugs mess you up! This world is fucked up beyond measure and people are angry and  pissed off. We live in scarier times now.Everyone watches everyone and everyone has a camera and camera's don't lie! I really hope Jesus Christ comes soon! I hate this world we live in! I really do! I am being gang stalked by a  large group of crazy people in VA I hate VA this place sucks so much and the people here are crazy and they fuck with  your head. Its all true. They are monsters here!",Ke6kU0rD8Jg

32770,"I always thought this movie was the first to feature zombies as fast movers, not like the slow shufflers of classic zombie movies like ""Dawn of the Dead."" It seems like most people think that ""28 Days Later"" was the first movie to feature fast moving zombies (technically not zombies but 'infected').",KeSAFGWzft8
32771,Classic,KeSAFGWzft8
32772,"This movie is so notorious for its comedy, people forget how incredibly nonstop nerve-wracking intense it can be. Dan O'Bannon (ROTLD, Alien, Dark Star) was an under-rated genius.",KeSAFGWzft8
32773,Had it's own style. Thumbs up,KeSAFGWzft8
32774,Directed by the guy who wrote Alien! Dan O'Bannon.,KeSAFGWzft8
32775,Man I wish the 2nd film we got should of been a direct sequel to o'bannons classic. If it was me and I got the budget and became a director for the film I would of made it a pure scary war zombie movie with its dark comedy with the zombies and kind of give some hope knowing humans can survive this style of a zombie apocalypse i would've still use the same style of o bannons zombies and i would make the hordes big and the sounds of there moans and screaming out crying for brains would sounds ghostly terrifying though it still can have a hopeless ending situation but I would have it to give the humans the chance to fight back against the zombies with swords and pretty much they can dismember the corpse Becuaee you still have a chance at sliceing the rotten flesh and escaping they can be defeated if you have swords and a acid gun to blind em so you have the full advantage to cut em to piece and still can get away. I wrote a script hat was a direct sequel and it took me 4 years of my high school to write but it was worth the time. My friends even thought it was a great script. I hope one day this franchise gets a new movie studio owner like New Line Cinema of even Blumhouse or hell even A24 the one company that did green room. The visual of there films are beautiful.,KeSAFGWzft8

32846,"«Сенсация» / Scoop (2006) 16+

Увлекательная детективная комедия Вуди Аллена, рассказывающая о любопытной журналистке, которая на пару с чудаковатым фокусником бросается в погоню за сенсацией. Легкая лента пропитана фирменным алленовским юмором, непривычно солнечным Лондоном, а главную роль здесь исполняет прелестная Скарлетт Йохансон, на тот момент окончательно утвердившаяся в статусе музы живого классика. Этот фильм в который раз убеждает: уж кому, а голливудскому гению в очках можно без опаски доверить дождливый осенний вечер.

Do some googling so you know that first of all Iran, similar to a lot of other countries, ""has"" deserts."" It is not a desert so that title is ridiculous. And second of all, you need to be more specific about a lot of the things you show in your movies. I WAS a fan of Freida but not anymore.

33534,"Man, I really want to see the Dark Universe continue!  We all love the idea of a cinematic universe of Universal's classic monsters and they would all form a great team!  Sure, 2017's ""The Mummy"" was a very poor setup to the Dark Universe, but I really like the idea of Javier Bardem as Frankenstein's Monster, Angelina Jolie as the Bride of Frankenstein, and Johnny Depp as the Invisible Man.  Doesn't this sound exciting to see these actors in a world alongside other big stars like Tom Cruise, Sofia Boutella, and Russell Crowe?  Since its hopefully back up in production again, we have hope that 2019's ""Bride of Frankenstein"" can save the Dark Universe by telling a good scary (but not necessarily gory) standalone story by locking down a timeline.  These are major improvements to the biggest problems that ""The Mummy"" had, like not having character and plot development, jump scares, and adequate pacing.  As explained in the opening scene, Sofia Boutella's Princess Amahnet, the titular main antagonist in ""The Mummy"" is basically the only character in the movie to have a backstory explained, but we barely know anything about Tom Cruise's Nick Morton, who of course is the main protagonist in the film, as he along with others are completely devoid of character development, making it nearly impossible for us to care about them.  The only thing the movie actually did right was the world building and setting up future installments.  Russell Crowe's Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde has a key role in connecting the Dark Universe since he owns Prodigium, which is the equivalent of Monarch, the organization in Legendary's Monsterverse, which started in 2014 with ""Godzilla"", and continued in 2017 with ""Kong: Skull Island"".  The problem is that the world building got in the way and they forgot about the movie at hand.  The Marvel Cinematic Universe spends most of its time on character and plot development and leads up to epic action sequences, as 2017's ""Wonder Woman"" followed in Marvel's footsteps, and we all know the upcoming ""Aquaman"" movie will do the same.  Similarly ""Godzilla"" had no world building at all, but ""Kong: Skull Island"", which turned out to be a prequel teased future installments with its post credit scene, which the MCU is most known for.  But unlike ""Godzilla"", ""Kong"" and all MCU movies and like ""Batman V. Superman: Dawn of Justice"", ""The Mummy"" had a very large portion focusing on world building and setting up future installments for the Dark Universe, that the narrative came to a screeching halt.  So basically, Nick Morton is fighting with Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde and Ahmanet is watching and is trying to bring the former back to reality and return to her evil scheme.  When it does get back to the main point, everything is resolved in a rather unsatisfactory way.  What I am saying is that there is still time to save the Dark Universe and learning our mistakes helps us improve with our accomplishments and we must not give up on a good idea!",Nn2G6YrvibM

33699,"In the late 70's, post STAR WARS, pre-EMPIRE STRIKES BACK ... starting at age 19, I was a 'Film Booker' for 20th Century-Fox (they had a 'hyphen' back then) in the San Francisco Branch that covered Northern California upwards to lower Oregon and parts of Nevada.

'HIGH ANXIETY' was one the first films I sent the 35MM prints out of.  (That is what bookers did then.  These days, a few people at the studio send the e-mail attached films ...)

Back then, we'd 'screen' the films for the Exhibitors in our Branch area prior to they made a 'Bid' for whichever film it was.  It was the '90/10' system.  Meaning the first week's grosses would be 90% for Fox -- second week 80% and etc., descending.

Mel Brooks made several films for Fox ... and back then, especially after 'YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN' (1984), the studio gave Mr. Brooks crate-blanche to whatever he wanted to make.

It was an exciting, fun, learning time for me -- as I knew in order to be a competent director -- one had to know all ends of the movie industry. 

One of the best parts was going to LucasFilm's ILM several times when they were first starting up in Marin County ... and this was when ILM was one lonely building in a vast wide nothing but weeds area on a small side street.

But that, is another story.

Thanks you, Mel Brooks for making the films I still quote to this day.

  So, one day we ended up moving to a slow, sleepy country-type town in Massachusetts for a year. 
   I swear, after being there about 3 or 4 months, one day we heard a siren. With my years of experience, i could tell immediately it was a fire truck. 
Everyone in the entire class runs over to the window in amazement. Mumbling things like ""I wonder what they're going to do!!"" and ""I bet there's a big forest fire somewhere!!"" Even the teacher ran over to look out at the fire truck. LMAO!!! Anyone who lives in a city knows why i found that hilarious. I was ""weird"" because i was the only one who didnt sprint over to the window. My teacher repeatedly asking me what was wrong and if i was feeling okay.

34055,"Up until the late 90's all war movies I saw made the allies out to be the hero's. We didnt have internet back then so everyone thought that the other countries were horrible savages who wanted you dead.
The internet broke that. 
To this day some media outlets trying to hold on to some fascade and convince people otherwise so that they can feed out of their hand and praise them for being heroes. 
Media sold me out and lied to everyone the same way. Now they plaster me with some negative image to keep people away from me in order to keep stealing from them and putting words in my mouth and so they dont discover the truth.

This is why medical kills off celebrities. They can keep selling the magazines and propaganda and media and make the millions that everyone thinks the celebrity is getting.
""Superstar"" just bought a huge mansion.
I bet they didnt. I bet they trying to sell said mansion. 
Ironically these people are often people that are trusted and then the editing begins and the media twist words. Like using a sound board. ""You can say a lot of different things and the full context of what you say might not always be forwarded.""
""the full context always be forwarded.""
For people that dont have the full picture to be given another patchy twisted picture it is impossible to have any opinion but the emotion that the church focuses on is the weapon that is used.
Spiirit this, faith, truth crucified, loved you, died for you, they become a pile of emotional wrecks. then medical comes along and fixes them with medication.
Right.
Feeding out of their hand.
Like the chickens on the farm.
When Celebrities die and millions of their fans ""Fanatic"" hear the news they throw themselves at the merchandise. Not only that but they also often focus on what killed them and that often becomes a seller as well.
Amy Whinehous..Alcohol...Look at sales when that happened.
River pheonix.....
Its medical and Media. They are not celebrities they are puppets.
I took a dive. I never been behind a camera yet the image still reached the world.
Thats GOD's work.
Companies want to cash it in.
I hope they died.

34102,This film has kind of a special meaning for me.  I saw it after I had graduated high school but before I left for college.  I was not the best student.  The scene where Newman and the East German are writing equations on the board and arguing about whether or not something that was built actually worked fascinated the hell out of me.  The idea that math could be used to describe the operation of physical systems was just amazing to me.  I became a professor of engineering so I could do what those two did in the movie......,z2TlfRvNh8M

I think what Symphony is lamenting about is that people should stop blaming god for the death of a dear one or trying to see god's mysterious ways in it - when it's just life. People die - of old age, cancer or accidents. It's a part of life. Human life. It's not god's wish or punishment. Life and death - an eternal balance if you want, the circle of life. No reason behind it - just life. And in your time of need you pray to god to give you strength to endure.",nzQ_9NaS6eA

34364,"OK Get ready to hear my rant. I loved this movie and I watched 1 and 2 yesterday night. I enjoyed the second one because it had way more action and it was really intense. I do have to say that as the Laurie-Michael showdown went on it started to get boring because every single time Michael was walking toward her slowly, she screams a lot, them narrowly escapes with a few seconds to spare. Still a great movie. Laurie definitely isnt the sharpest tool in the shed because when she is at the entrance to the hospital, she could have got into the car next to her (The wheels were fine unlike all other cars and the keys were never taken out of the car) Again, great movie, *SPOILER* I am sad Loomis died, I liked him :( 
Also, sorry for this whole rant, I needed to let my feelings out. Don't hate me for anything I said, it's just my opinion and I am sorry if I offended anyone.

I finally saw this for the first time and instantly fell in love with this movie and its characters. This movie also has one of the most iconic and famous scenes when Rocky runs up the steps and this movie also has one of the most epic fights Rocky Balboa vs Apollo Creed. One thing I would have to say is that I love how the movies leave right off each other.  Everyone is excellent in this movie I love Burgess Meredith as Mickey one of the best characters in the films, Carl Weathers as Apollo Creed was great, Talia Shire as Adrian was amazing and Burt Young as Paulie was awesome. The acting, directing and music are amazing. If you have not seen this movie then I recommend you do. This movie is Cinematastic rating 5/5",7RYpJAUMo2M
