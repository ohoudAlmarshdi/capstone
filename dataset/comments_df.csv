But when he sang the line ""is this the start of something wonderful, or one more dream, that i cannot make true"" .. he was actually singing about the dream to find the true love with mia (he kind of felt, she was the right one just by then), but he was afraid to not being able to make this dream come true, because by that time, Mia was still together with this other Guy Greg. Also when ""City of stars"" is played in full lenght later, the lyrics lead to this idea as well. In the last scene of La La Land, when they both have the ""flashback"" of how things should have been going, they both realized, they had given up the real dream: true love.

What a powerful scene and the most remembered. This is almost a three-hour film but it does not feel like it because you are so engaged with it. The locations they picked just made the movie that more authentic, hey if you are going to make a movie about a Scotsman do it in Scotland. I\'m pretty sure almost everyone saw this movie so this won\'t be a spoiler but I was so upset that he died but when he denied the king mercy and said freedom even though you know he will die you still root for him. Patrick McGoohan who plays Longshanks the king is a threatening and menace presence and he does a fantastic job at it and you hate that character with a purple passion. There is not a single thing wrong with this movie. The acting is amazing, the story is amazing, directing is amazing and the music is amazing. I\'m so glad that Mel directed this movie because he knew what he wanted and if it was someone else we would not have gotten this masterpiece. there is a reason why it won so many awards.

John Rambo.', 'Better than all three Expandables, hopefully Rambo 5 will be kickass.', 'Best movie ever made.', ""The first 3 films of this series have been easily the more intelligent and relatable, for instance the 3rd film had at least some character development and spiritual and political side it was developing by showing how Soviets didn't learn from The US involvement in Vietnam, it even dared to go beyond the characters and more into philosophical matters of politics, sacrifice, self awareness, loyalty and serving Gods. I wish the next film tries to enrich its storyline without compensating for it by trying to be so-called realistic. It is not more realistic than any other Rambo film, it's an interpretation of realism, to be realistic you'd have to be there and being shot at. Realism in movies is an illusion based on subjective perception, what was deemed realistic 50 years ago can be cheesy now. If you were on battlefield you'd rarely ever see in such detail all the mayhem, you try to look away, this movie seems cartoonish to some people exactly because it revels in its violent detail, therefore it's harder to take seriously. Interpretation of realism is the key, not realism itself, that is an illusion driven by ego pushing an agenda of how reality is, remember everyone perceives reality differently, and audience naturally responds to a film as a piece of fiction and not as a documentary, but it can help them look into the things the film is based on. In terms of quality it's easily the weakest film of the series, but still good. There's a reason for the bigger success of the first 3 films, they were enjoyed equally by both males and females, because that was more light hearted to show dark realities of war, it was the interpretation that made a difference. One can not make a difference if the film is told in an inaccesible way, this sequel is more niche for niche audience than the first 3 films which were more mainstream with wider appeal. You use a specific tool and style to shine light on something, so far this film was as accessible almost as a documentary rather than a film seen by most. Filmmakers were even indecisive whether to use f bomb in the second film, that's how it matterd how they sell their interpretation of reality, because they knew that it's about selling awareness of such events to help people look into them more, realism should be the least of the concern when the audience doesn't take films as an evidence of what is real, people know it is not a documentary, why try selling it this way by alienating your wider and bigger audience?? Use the way that MOST people can stay with and look through.\n\nTo me it's a switch the brain off type of mindless action, 3/4th of the film is a video game non stop violence, not much development of characters like in most action war films, here the third act goes nowhere, straight forward by the numbers action film. The more you employ your brain the dumber the film appears to be."", ""The bad things about Rambo IV:\n\nI. It's gratuitous hard R-rating.\nII.

72,2TAOizOnNPo,"['Point Break with Cars', 'By far the best F&F film to date. However...i have to say, I am really impressed with the fact that a franchise can make 8+ movies, and *_still_* not only are thry on the big screen, but most of them are pretty damn good...some are okay and some are great. But the way they keep it all going with the plot twists, almost always different plotlines, bringing in new celebrity actors for almost every new film (Dwayne Johnson, Kurt Russell, Charlize Theron, female UFC fighters such as Ronda Rousey üëàLoL!!), all while keeping the same, original crew together after 17+ years. Now *_THAT_* is impressive. I don\'t care what anyone says.\nPeople are so accustomed to and used to a movie franchise that has so many sequels (Friday The 13th, Halloween, Saw, Star Wars, The Alien Franchise, Final Destination, Jaws, i could go on all day) to automatically just being really really bad and not worth watching. And in their defense, most of them are pretty awful, and also are usually so bad they go straight to DvD (Think: Child\'s Play). \nSo anyway, when someone goes into a movie with the frame of mind that it\'s going to be really bad, well, it usually is because they have that frame of mind for the entire film. Usually just waiting for it to take that hard left turn. Which it usually does. But when it turns out to be really good, they might think ""well, this wasnt bad at all"" but since they had that frame of mind for the entire film, it\'s almost impossible for them to forget all about the fact that you thought it would suck, and you can\'t really enjoy it as much as you could have, had you gone into the movie with an open mind, or thinking that it just might be good.\n   So anyway, this post is long, sorry. To the point...\nIf you go back and re-watch ANY of these sequels that you thought were bad or ""would be"" bad, and you make yourself think they are going to be really great, then you will certainly enjoy it more, and also you will probably like it. \n  It\'s all a psychological thing and it really works. \nJust a brief example: way back when, I was just a kid and went to see \'Titanic\' in the theater. I really disliked that type of movie as a kid, like most kids do. And initially didnt want to see it. But eventually i heard from several people, all over school, all over the tv, how amazing it was, and how everyone wants to see it again, etc. \nWhen i saw it, I liked it a lot. However, about 5 years ago I watched it again. Surprisingly i hadnt seen it since i was about 14 so i forgot most of it. Anyway, i didnt like it much at all and was curious as to why i liked such a film *_more_* at 14 than as an adult? It should\'ve been the other way around. \nBut again, it\'s all a psychological thing and bcuz i went into the theater with the mindset that it was a great movie. So i really actually enjoyed it at the time. \n   Anyway, thats something i learnes in college about how the mind works and can sometimes play tricks on you.

Then he wrote down the dream:[a] 2 I,[b] Daniel, saw in my vision by night the four winds of heaven stirring up the great sea, 3 and four great beasts came up out of the sea, different from one another. 4 The first was like a lion and had eagles‚Äô wings. Then, as I watched, its wings were plucked off, and it was lifted up from the ground and made to stand on two feet like a human being; and a human mind was given to it. 5 Another beast appeared, a second one, that looked like a bear. It was raised up on one side, had three tusks[c] in its mouth among its teeth and was told, ‚ÄúArise, devour many bodies!‚Äù 6 After this, as I watched, another appeared, like a leopard. The beast had four wings of a bird on its back and four heads; and dominion was given to it. 7 After this I saw in the visions by night a fourth beast, terrifying and dreadful and exceedingly strong. It had great iron teeth and was devouring, breaking in pieces, and stamping what was left with its feet. It was different from all the beasts that preceded it, and it had ten horns. 8 I was considering the horns, when another horn appeared, a little one coming up among them; to make room for it, three of the earlier horns were plucked up by the roots. There were eyes like human eyes in this horn, and a mouth speaking arrogantly.\n\nJudgment before the Ancient One\n9 As I watched,\nthrones were set in place,\n    and an Ancient One[d] took his throne,\nhis clothing was white as snow,\n    and the hair of his head like pure wool;\nhis throne was fiery flames,\n    and its wheels were burning fire.\n10 A stream of fire issued\n    and flowed out from his presence.\nA thousand thousands served him,\n    and ten thousand times ten thousand stood attending him.\nThe court sat in judgment,\n    and the books were opened.\n\n11 I watched then because of the noise of the arrogant words that the horn was speaking. And as I watched, the beast was put to death, and its body destroyed and given over to be burned with fire. 12 As for the rest of the beasts, their dominion was taken away, but their lives were prolonged for a season and a time. 13 As I watched in the night visions,\n\nI saw one like a human being[e]\n    coming with the clouds of heaven.\nAnd he came to the Ancient One[f]\n    and was presented before him.\n14 To him was given dominion\n    and glory and kingship,\nthat all peoples, nations, and languages\n    should serve him.\nHis dominion is an everlasting dominion\n    that shall not pass away,\nand his kingship is one\n    that shall never be destroyed.\n\nDaniel‚Äôs Visions Interpreted\n15 As for me, Daniel, my spirit was troubled within me,[g] and the visions of my head terrified me. 16 I approached one of the attendants to ask him the truth concerning all this. So he said that he would disclose to me the interpretation of the matter: 17 ‚ÄúAs for these four great beasts, four kings shall arise out of the earth. 18 But the holy ones of the Most High shall receive the kingdom and possess the kingdom forever‚Äîforever and ever.‚Äù\n\n19 Then I desired to know the truth concerning the fourth beast, which was different from all the rest, exceedingly terrifying, with its teeth of iron and claws of bronze, and which devoured and broke in pieces, and stamped what was left with its feet; 20 and concerning the ten horns that were on its head, and concerning the other horn, which came up and to make room for which three of them fell out‚Äîthe horn that had eyes and a mouth that spoke arrogantly, and that seemed greater than the others. 21 As I looked, this horn made war with the holy ones and was prevailing over them, 22 until the Ancient One[h] came; then judgment was given for the holy ones of the Most High, and the time arrived when the holy ones gained possession of the kingdom.\n\n23 This is what he said: ‚ÄúAs for the fourth beast,\n\nthere shall be a fourth kingdom on earth\n    that shall be different from all the other kingdoms;\nit shall devour the whole earth,\n    and trample it down, and break it to pieces.\n24 As for the ten horns,\nout of this kingdom ten kings shall arise,\n    and another shall arise after them.\nThis one shall be different from the former ones,\n    and shall put down three kings.\n25 He shall speak words against the Most High,\n    shall wear out the holy ones of the Most High,\n    and shall attempt to change the sacred seasons and the law;\nand they shall be given into his power\n    for a time, two times,[i] and half a time.\n26 Then the court shall sit in judgment,\n    and his dominion shall be taken away,\n    to be consumed and totally destroyed.\n27 The kingship and dominion\n    and the greatness of the kingdoms under the whole heaven\n    shall be given to the people of the holy ones of the Most High;\ntheir kingdom shall be an everlasting kingdom,\n    and all dominions shall serve and obey them.‚Äù\n\n28 Here the account ends. As for me, Daniel, my thoughts greatly terrified me, and my face turned pale; but I kept the matter in my mind.']"

That unverified theories propose is a consequence of a virus that originally evolved inside primate populations (quite possibly bonobo chimpanzees, due to excessive sexual behavior also).\n\nThat then jumped species into humans, with the help of sexual deviants (who are prevalent in certain social bodies, like mercenary armies and foreign legions - more so in informal or clandestine militias \n\nWho are driven by psycho-social forces (in exile or under duress) to find economic and sociopolitical opportunities elsewhere (driven away by their own communities, or dominant groups of the area). To join these profit oriented organizations.\n\nSo that theories propose, that with the concentration of such personality types in such standing bodies, sent out by military or para-military campaigns into far flung areas (like Belgian Congo, or anywhere else in the World really). \n\nWhether as combatants or non-combatants (motif remains securing resources and opportunity for larger organizations, while addressing own personal and private needs.

Also what about boronic water to cool, and pre-stage ion exchange with titanium oxide and salt before distillation to separate the waste instead of  dumping the approx. 300 metric tons  of contaminated sea water per day (used to cool the leaking reactor) back into the ocean?  Maybe CA should be piping Atlantic water for ocean/solar powered desalination or distillation and keep the Pacific off tap for now.\n\n check out what's happening to the Pacific.  These things should never have more than a 30 day supply of feul. This thing will maybe burn for 40 years. And think of every reactor currently stocked with that much fuel. If a reactor had a meltdown in the US every energy company would be scratching their heads as to how to unstock it with a 40 year supply of uranium when then need the meltdown to stop yesterday.\n\nAnd a 40 year feul supply in a reactor built on a vault line at the shore of an ocean had to be the worst zoning ever\n\nA 40 year feul supply in a reactor is a way to kill the future\n\nSelling 40 years worth of feul at once to get paid today due what you won't be alive to seek about in 40 years, no problem, but then it should be stored separately and away from the reactor: off-site\n\nOr maybe we'll all learn after the next 5 meltdowns...\n\nAlso toilets.. \n\n\nIf only toilets didn't contaminate all the wastewater with viruses and bacteria that even build a protective shell around them to even resist chlorine and which point of use filters say they  remove from the incoming  potable water. In naure purification at its finest is evaporation, collection of vapor- condensation, rains, sand filtration, water again, maybe DeKa has an affordable steam distillation solution which would add steam disinfection for a new toilet to reduse waste to a disposable solid in a disposable compartment with a disposable liner that reduces human waste to a brick which goes to a landfill, like cat litter does, and whatever small amount of water and moisture used  steams out, disinfected as water vapor, then the wastewater is not contaminated by sewage etc, and the rivers won't smell like each town, and we'll reduce the amount of ammonia in the gulf, and wastewater minus all the toilet contamination from even entering will be more easily cleaned for use in irrigation, and perhaps the future bottled water companies will also use ocean desalination until it can be pipes directly as potable water through existing supply lines, and towns could easily hook up to a main line running from ocean desalination plants through all 50 states, Though CA and the rest of the US should be piping from the Atlantic now and using ocean kinetic and solar energy for desalination or distillation.  And some places are re-using waste water, going Toilet-to-Tap, their brains stopped there and went no further but to tell everyone drinking it that that's their best idea and it's great\n\nBack to the toilet, the waste line at the toilet connection could be separated from the rest of the household plumbing and go down to a pit, or collector in the basement or outside the house, where household water is separated from waste with DeKa distillation and the solid waste removed in self sealing disposable containers.  It would eliminate a lot of treatment burden and treatment cost might go down on the city side,  while rise a little on the  users end, but with adjustments stay about the same per household."", 'üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ', 'single female lawyer\nfighting for her client\nwearing sexy miniskirts\nand being self-reliant', 'bord et bord', ""i just heard that this brockovich is a actual person with respectable goals and achievements.. i had to search this trailer because the name ringed from when i saw the commercial for this film in finland, ever since i've thought this movie was a fictional comedy about a single mother who's ex- stripper or prostitute and gets a job in some law firm..\n\nwow, how can a hollywood movie commercial give such a wrong picture about a actual historical human.. :D"", 'so...shes so smart that she had a kid at 16 and divorced twice,yep genius material', '_+_  I love this movie', 'She was magnificent in this film!']"

They get attacked all the time, one time a couple of teenagers set a homeless man on fire and video taped it! They got life in prison and death! Whatever faults people may have when they make mistakes people judge them and that is wrong b/c nobody is perfect not even family! You know I never drank but if I hit rock bottom I would probably do what Ben did just say fuck it! Nobody cares, I chose not to drink! Drugs mess you up! This world is fucked up beyond measure and people are angry and\xa0 pissed off. We live in scarier times now.Everyone watches everyone and everyone has a camera and camera's don't lie! I really hope Jesus Christ comes soon! I hate this world we live in! I really do!

Eighteen thousand landslides occurred on January 5, 1982 that killed 33 in San Francisco on the 49th anniversary of the start of the Golden Gate Bridge which also coincided with Marilyn Mansons 13th birthday. On January 5, 2018 Manson turned 49 and the Kodovar volcano erupted for the first time in recorded history. Philadelphia is one of the 7 churches of Revelation. The Eagles won there first Superbowl in 2018. Philly to Canton Ohio is 333 miles as the crow flies. Canton is where Manson was born and is home of the football Hall of Fame. Canton to Chicago is 333 miles as the crow flies. This adds up to the 666 the number of the beast. Chicago is where Anton Lavey published the satanic the same year Manson was born. They became friends after first meeting at the  ‚ÄúBlack house‚Äù in SF where Anyone founded the church of Satan. Alcatraz is named the Rock which stands for Peter the Rock Jesus\'s best friend. When the Birdman of Alcatraz died he was buried in Metropolis Superman\'s hometown. The steel used to build the Golden Gate is Bethlehem Steel named after Jesus\'s hometown. Metropolis is 333 miles as the crow flies from Ft. Wayne my hometown. San Francisco is named for the same Saint that the pope chose his papal name to be. The flag of SF is of the Phoenix, a mythical bird who is associated with Jesus because of its ability to resurrect. In the 1962 movie ""the Birdman of Alcatraz"" the first bird he saves is a sparrow which he names Jack.\xa0 In Pirates of the Caribbean Johny Depp plays Captain Jack Sparrow. Johnny Depp, the Birdman of Miami, and Birdman the rapper are all named Christopher. Birdman the movie was originally written to involve Johnny Depp. Depp is best friends with Marilyn Manson who In 1996 said ""Hopefully I will be remembered for the one who brought an end to Christianity."" That same year he released ""Antichrist Superstar."" I was born on January 27, 1980 and the Birdman was born on January 28, 1890. On January 28, 1986 the space shuttle Challenger exploded killing all 7 on board including a school teacher named Christa. Every ten year anniversary since people who has had a very significant impact on the world have died and they are all connected by a bird, a plane, and Superman. On the first 10 year anniversary Jerry Siegal the creator of Superman died on January 28, 1996, The Birdman\'s 106th B-day. 10 years later Rabbi Yitskah Kaduri died January 28, 2006. Rabbi Kaduri had the largest funeral in Israel\'s history and is known for writing a letter which was opened a year after his death which states Jesus is the true Messiah. Ten years later Signe Toly and Paul Kantner of Jefferson Airplane from SF died on January 28, 2016. On the 5 year anniversary of the death of the Rabbi an Angel appeared over the Dome of Rock  on January 28, 2011. George Reeves who was the only Superman to be killed was born on January 5 as well which coincides with National bird day. Revelation talks about how birds devour the antichrist and his armies. Alfred Hitchcock\'s movie ""The Birds"" was filmed in SF. Morgan Stanley who was born 49 years before the Birdman was the was the inspiration for the book ""Heart of Darkness."" The Birdman was sent to Alcatraz for stabbing a guard through the heart. In 1996 I became paralyzed the first time I heard the song ""Beautiful People."" In 2001 a demons voice guided me to Mansons autobiography ""The Long Hard Road out Of Hell."" In 2003 Carmelo Anthony led the Syracuse Orangemen to their first NCAA title in 2003 over Kansas. The morning after that game I walked the yellow brick road after almost drowning where the St. Joseph and St. Marys rivers meet.\xa0 The first person I met at St. Joe was a man who claimed to be OZ. OZ had a branding on his forearm that had the ""Echo"" logo on it. The Rhinoceros logo was the same size and shape of the logo on the side of the reddish orange Echo shoes I was given earlier that day by my friend Scot after I got out of the river barefoot. ‚Äúthe Dark side of the Rainbow"" is a story about how Pink Floyds Darkside of the moon syncs up with the Wizard of Oz. This story originated with a 1995 Journal Gazette article in Ft Wayne the same city I walked the yellow brick road 8 years later. 2003 was the same year I climbed the Anthony Wayne building on St. Pat\'s. It was an Orange year in 2003. The Ft. Wayne Komets, the Buccaneers,\xa0 and the Orangemen all won that year.\xa0My stepdad Joseph owned a motorcycle shop which was orange and all of his drag racing motorcycles were orange as well. The Wizard of OZ is a story about the defeat of the antichrist. The water making the Witch melt is a metaphor for baptism. All of the teams in Fort Wayne are named after the Wizard of OZ. The Tin Caps are the baseball team which would be The Tin Woodsman. Before they were the Tin caps they were the Wizards. Johnny Appleseed is the original Tin woodsman who is buried in Ft. Wayne. The Komet hockey team used to be the Choppers. Nick Chopper is the Tin Man\'s name.The Ft. Wayne Mad Ants would be the ‚ÄúAunty M‚Äôs.‚Äù In ""Return to Oz"" Dorothy is sent to the psyche ward. The Doctor tries to give her a shock treatment then lighting knocks the power out. Dorothy escapes out of a window and gets swept away by a river which takes her back to OZ. In 2003 I got swept away by a river where I ended up meeting OZ in the phyche ward. The Doctor then tried to give me a shock treatment. I tried to escape out of the window as well. I haven\'t aged a day since the river incident in 2003 when I was 23. My mothers first tattoo was Peter Pan on her neck and she still doesn\'t know who I am. I used to rap as Reaces Peace\'s and Marshall Mathers  rapped as M&M. M&M was born in St. Joseph Missouri and I was born at St. Joseph Hospital. We are both left handed and have blue eyes. M&M\'s middle name is Bruce and he grew up in Wayne county. Batman is Bruce Wayne named after Mad Anthony Wayne the founder of Batman. Peter the Rock is the original Batman. Peter was crucified upside down upon his request. There was a man on the Kansas team in 2003 whose name is Wayne Anthony the founder of Ft. Wayne\'s name backwards. Wayne who later won an NBA title with Miami was injured and could not play in that championship game. Wayne is now a preacher. The son of man is Jesus and the son of man backwards is Man son. Peyton Manning went to play for a horse of a different color, from the Colts to the Broncos. Brock OS(OZ) Weiller Quarterbacked most of there Superbowl winning season. Manning‚Äôs favorite thing to say at the line of scrimmage was‚ÄúOmaha."" Omaha is what is written on the side of the Hot Air Balloon at the end of the Wizard of Oz. In Superbowl 48 Peyton was defeated by, ‚Äúthe Emerald city"", Seattle. In Super Bowl 50 Peyton defeated Superman at the 49ers Cathedral. I was born on January 27, the same as Nick Mason of Pink Floyd. The Dark side of the moon starts with the song ""Breathe"" which has a lyric ""run rabbit run."" Eminem played ""B Rabbit"" in the movie 8 mile which is based on ‚ÄúRun rabbit run"" written by John Updyke. John died 7 years later on my birthday. M&M released the song ""the Yellow Brick road"" and Elton John released the album ‚Äúleaving the Yellow Brick road."" At the 2001 Grammys they performed the song ""Stan,"" together. M&M released his autobiography ""the dark side of Eminem"" the chapter ""Stan"" starts on my birthday page 127. Stan Lee created Spiderman and when Dorothy runs away the first person she meets is professor Marvel. Spiderman is from Marvel comics. I became Spiderman in 2003 and also dated Mary Jane who was also born in Canton Ohio the same city as Marilyn Manson. Andre the Giant who shares my last name and who also climbed walls of insanity in the Princess Bride died on my 13th Birthday 1/27/93. Andre was born exactly 127 miles from where my Great Grandfather was born in Belfort France. Belfort is the birthplace of the man who sculpted the statue of Liberty. My name Nickolas Giant contains two New York teams. Manson has been working on the movie ‚ÄúPhantasmagoria"" where he plays an evil Lewis Carrol. Lewis lived most of his life from a college named after Christ. Carrol who wrote Alice in Wonderland was also born on January 27. Johnny Depp played the Mad Hatter. The founder of Ft. Wayne is Mad Anthony Wayne. Barbara Hershey who played Mary Magdalene in Oliver Stone‚Äôs last Temptation of Christ was on the set of a movie when she felt the Spirit of a Seagull enter her body. She then changed her last name to Seagull. In 2002 Ja Rule played an inmate on Alcatraz alongside Steven Seagull under the name ""Nickolas"" in the movie Half past Dead. In 2003 Ja Rule was trying to murder 50 Cent the same time I felt he was trying to murder me. There is a reason 50 Cent got shot 9 times and didn\'t die. In 2001 After a trip from Detroit with my best friend Life a red orb appeared and told me it was my Angel of light. It then told me I was Jesus.

For example the main dinosaur usually looks perfectly fine. But there are other parts in the film where an insignificant dinosaur will walk past the screen for five seconds and it will look like absolute shit. Kind of like the animals from the old Jumanji. Not that I'm saying Jumanji was a bad film. But let's be honest the CGI was terrible. Then there is the writing which is often at the same level of quality as the old Jurassic Park. But there are also moments where the writing suddenly plummets in quality to such an extent that I'm not even sure what is happening. Like when the mother abruptly starts crying. She says some crap about the importance of family. But apparently she is too much of a snob to spend any time with her sister herself. So it just comes across as gibberish to me. Secondly how the hell does an animal know what the hell a tracking device is? Even a human being wouldn't know what the hell a tracking device is unless it was explained to them. It doesn't matter how intelligent you are. There still needs to be a basis for the assumption that the device is magically giving away your location. They never suggested that the dinosaur just found the device to be itchy. It was meant to be a demonstration of its intelligence. Apparently the dinosaur remembers where they surgically implanted the tracking device. But I assume they would have sedated it first in which case it should have no memory of anything past that it woke up one day with a sore shoulder or wherever the hell they put it. Don't get me wrong I enjoyed the film for the most part. I'm just saying that there are these weird moments where there is a sudden plummet in quality.

Which is right?\' Unfortunately, the response I got was, \'Nice boys don\'t ask that question.\' A light went off, and I said, \'The Bible doesn\'t make sense.

(those started around then, i may have been slightly older when i saw some of them, but not much older.) no worries, i do not trace pictures. my drawings are my own, my style is similar to kevin long's in ways because i liked his work.

(28-29 ish.) i looked identical to the king in the warcraft movie they made. so another oddity. ( im not sure if my hair was blond when i was 28. i had dyed it green at one point around then it was brown initially. the green had faded out making me blond. yes i bleached it first to make the green sharper. i wanted vancouver blue, but it was the wrong color. the sales clerk on white ave, lied. i do travel sometimes.) the warcraft movie came out later though. (after i moved to kamloops.)\n\ni will mention, my hair was blond and i was thinner due to starvation when i was 29. i looked identical to the thor movie poster. (it was a big poster on the theater wall.) i went to see it on a day pass when i was in the hospital.

Almost like Jesus was like Mr. Spock from Star Trek - completely devoid of emotion.\n\nWhereas with Willem's portrayal, Jesus seems like a man who laughs and cries, just like any other man, and like someone who takes care of his own needs.\n\nHis portrayal is makes Jesus feel like someone we can all relate too!\n\n#2: Many of the other actors who portrayed Jesus were way to thin and pale. They made Jesus look almost sickly.\n\nWillem on the other hand, though he is slender, he still looks healthy. And therefore he makes Jesus look both healthy and strong enough, that he could've been a carpenter back then.\n\nFrom what I've read about carpentry work, back then it was a very physically demanding job. \n\nNot to mention the fact that people back then walked everywhere they went, and the terrain around that area was often times rocky and hilly.\n\nSo that in itself is gonna require being in good physical health, and a degree of strength.\n\n#3: Most of the other actors who portrayed Jesus, their costumes were always pure white, and had this almost strange glow to them.\n\nWhere as Willem's Jesus not only has some color to his wardrobe, but also his clothes don't have any real glimmer to them.\n\nNot to mention, but when other actors in films have portrayed Christ, it seems like they've always tried to make their voice sound more robust or unique in some way, where is Willem Dafoe just simply talks normally. So it makes his Jesus more like an average guy.\n\nHe looks and sounds basically like an average guy you might see walking down the street back then, until you notice the way that he lives his life, and the way that he talks, not just the sound of his voice.\n\nI think that Willem could've played Jesus in the spirit of how he did here, while the filmmakers could've still stuck to what was written in the Bible."", 'I heard Christians do not like this movie .. my Mom always told me not to watch it..so I never have ..heard it was horrible', 'As an atheist I absolutely loved this film and the book is absolutely incredible..Powerful, heady stuff...It will stay with you forever...']"
