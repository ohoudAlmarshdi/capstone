# Capstone Project

Your Capstone project is the culmination of your time at GA. You will be tasked with developing an interesting question, collecting the data required to model that data, developing the strongest model (or models) for prediction, and communicating those findings to other data scientists and non-technical individuals. This introductory document lays out the five consitutent portions of the project and their due dates.

## Your Deliverables

- A well-made predictive model using either structured or unstructured machine learning techniques (or other technique approved in advanced by the global instructors), as well as clean, well-written code. 
- A technical report aimed at fellow data scientists that explains your process and findings
- A public presentation of your findings aimed at laypeople. 

### **[Capstone, Part 1: Topic Talk](./part_01/)**

In Part 1, you have already chosen a topic, but now it sis time to dicsuss it with other. We will divide into groups and discuss your capstone idea describing your goals & criteria for success, potential audience(s), and identifying your dataset. In the field of data science, good projects are practical. Your capstone project should be manageable and affect a real world audience. This might be a domain you are familiar with, a particular interest you have, something that affects a community you are involved in, or an area that relates to a field you wish to work in.

One of the best ways to test ideas quickly is to share them with others. A good data scientist has to be comfortable discussing ideas and presenting to audiences. That's why for Part 1 of your Capstone project, you'll be preparing a lightning talk. Each student in the group will have 3 minutes to present their topic, scope, and then recieve feedback from their peers as to problems they anticipate you to have as well as suggestions/ questions they may have that maybe you havent thought of.

**The ultimate choice of topic for your capstone project is yours!** However, this is research and development work. Sometimes projects that look easy can be difficult and vice versa. It never hurts to have a second (or third) option available.


### **[Capstone, Part 2: Problem Statement + EDA + notebook](./part_02/)**

By now, you're ready to apply your modeling skills to make machine learning predictions. Your goal for Part 2 is to develop a technical document (in the form of Jupyter notebook) that can be shared among your peers with your initial EDA, and summarize yours process thus far.

Document your research and analysis including a summary, an explanation of your inital EDA and thoughts on your modeling approach as well as the strengths and weaknesses of any variables in the process. You should eventually provide insight into your analysis, using best practices like cross validation or applicable prediction metrics.

- **Goal**: Jupyter notebook with DS workflow outlined, you intial EDA and clean data sections filled out, with maybe some of the modeling work begun. 

### **[Capstone, Part 3: Presentation + Recommendations](./part_05/)**

Whether during an interview or as part of a job, you will frequently have to present your findings to business partners and other interested parties - many of whom won't know anything about data science! That's why for Part 3, you'll create a presentation of your previous findings with a non-technical audience in mind.

You should already have the analytical work complete, so now it's time to clean up and clarify your findings. Come up with a detailed slide deck or interactive demo that explains your data, visualizes your model, describes your approach, articulates strengths and weaknesses, and presents specific recommendations. Be prepared to explain and defend your model to an inquisitive audience!

- **Goal**: Detailed presentation deck that relates your data, model, and findings to a non-technical audience.
- **Due**:
